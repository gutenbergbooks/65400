  <h3>
    CHAPTER VII<br />
    A Friend on the Enemy’s Side
    </h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story opens in the year of 1777, during one
of the most critical periods of the Revolution.
Hadley Morris, our hero, is in the employ of Jonas
Benson, the host of the Three Oaks, a well-known
inn on the road between Philadelphia and New
York. Like most of his neighbors, Hadley is an
ardent sympathizer with the patriot cause. When,
therefore, a dispatch bearer is captured on the way
to Philadelphia, he gives Hadley the all-important
packet to be forwarded to General Washington.
The boy immediately escapes with it, and, after
many perilous experiences, finally makes his way
across the river to the Pennsylvania side. On the
road, Hadley, failing to give the countersign, is
stopped by a foraging party of Americans; but by
his honest bearing he wins the attention of John
Cadwalader, a personal friend of Washington, just
then journeying to the American headquarters.
Under his protection, our hero speedily arrives at
his destination, and there, in an interview with
General Washington himself, he tells his story and
delivers the dispatches, which, because of the impending
crisis, are received eagerly by the head of
the patriot cause.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE collie rattled his chain at the
corner of the sheep pen, and from
a low growl changed his welcome to
a bark of delight and frisked about Hadley’s
legs as the boy stopped to pat him. The
house door across the paved yard opened
and the innkeeper’s voice cried: “Be still,
Bose! Who’s out there?”</p>

<p>Hadley went nearer and laughed.
“What’s the matter, Master Benson?” he
asked. “Are the dragoons still about the
place?”</p>

<p>At once the innkeeper plunged down the
steps, and, reaching the boy, seized him
tightly in his arms. “Had! Had!” he
cried, “why did you come back to the
Three Oaks? We thought you’d join the
army for sure this time.”</p>

<p>“Is the colonel still here?” asked Hadley,
in haste, and drawing back from the inn.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s here,” grunted Jonas, “but he
can’t do anything to you. The dragoons
are no longer at the Mills. Malcolm’s
troop started for York this morning.
There’s something going to happen ’fore
long, for the British are stirring, and they
say Lord Howe has sailed with his fleet.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said the boy, with some pride.
“There’s going to be a big battle, or something.
Those papers I ran away with told
all about Lord Howe’s plans, and now our
generals will be able to meet him.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?” Jonas asked, open-mouthed
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“I heard General Washington himself
say so,” declared the boy, and then, having
entered the wide inn kitchen, and, finding
it empty, he had to sit down and relate the
particulars of his ride to Germantown, and
his brief interview with the Commander-in-Chief
of the American forces.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of that Colonel Cadwalader,”
Jonas said, drawing a long breath, “and
you were certainly lucky to make such a
powerful friend, Hadley. Why didn’t you
join the army? You’d make a good soldier,
and perhaps get to be a captain, or something.
Men rise quick from the ranks
now-a-days.”</p>

<p>“You know very well why I cannot enlist,”
Hadley replied, gravely. “If Uncle
Ephraim should tell me I could go, I might
feel as though I would not be breaking
my word by enlisting. But unless he says
so, I don’t see how I can do it, much as I
would like.”</p>

<p>The innkeeper shook his head. “Ah,
boy, there’s plenty of time yet for you, after
all, it’s likely. The struggle is bound to
be a long one. The king is sending over
more troops, they say, and there’s a big
force marching from Canada. We’ll never
give up till we’re free; but most of us may
be dead before freedom comes.”</p>

<p>Mistress Benson came in a minute later,
and her delight at seeing Hadley safe and
sound again was sincere, although, as
Jonas had admitted to the boy’s private
ear, she was none too sympathetic with the
patriot cause. She set before the boy a
bountiful repast and made him eat his fill.
Then he retired to his usual couch in the
loft of the great barn and slept undisturbed
until morning.</p>

<p>He was currying down Black Molly in
the open door of the stable before breakfast
when Colonel Knowles chanced to stroll
into the inn yard. The Englishman
stopped and stared at the stableboy with a
lowering brow. Hadley kept at work,
whistling cheerfully, but a little amused at
the colonel’s evident surprise, and not at
all sure what the outcome of the meeting
might be.</p>

<p>“Well, young man!” exclaimed the
guest; “you certainly are a youth of mettle
to dare come back here after what occurred
the other day. Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“You are a guest of Master Benson’s,
sir,” Hadley said, quietly.</p>

<p>“I am an officer in His Majesty’s army,
sir.”</p>

<p>“But you are in the enemy’s country just
now, Colonel Knowles,” the boy said,
softly. “The dragoons are no longer within
call, and although there are some Tories
in the neighborhood, there are more men
who hold to the cause of the Colonies. I
think I am safer to come back here than
you are to remain.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the colonel; but the
words evidently impressed him. After a
moment of sullen silence he said: “They
tell me your name is Morris; is that so?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a person named Ephraim
Morris living in this part of the country?”</p>

<p>“That is my uncle’s name,” declared the
boy, and his interest grew, for he remembered
his conversation two days before
with Mistress Lillian.</p>

<p>“How old a man is he?” demanded Colonel
Knowles, with some eagerness.</p>

<p>“Rising sixty, sir. He is a farmer and
lives not more than four miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Englishman, turning
finally on his heel, “you’re a worthy nephew
of such an uncle, I don’t doubt.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Uncle Ephraim would not
agree with you,” Hadley called after the
gentleman. “He is a Tory.”</p>

<p>But Colonel Knowles paid no further attention
to him, and the boy went on with
his work. But his mind ran continually
on the interest the colonel and his daughter
evidently had in old Ephraim Morris.
Mistress Lillian herself appeared after
breakfast, and while Hadley was clearing
up the entrance to the inn yard. Jonas
Benson prided himself on having everything
about the inn as neatly kept as did
his wife inside the house.</p>

<p>“Hadley Morris!” the colonel’s daughter
exclaimed, leaning over the railing of the
inn porch and looking at the youth with
sparkling eyes. “Has my father seen you?
Mistress Benson told me you had come
back and that she was afraid father would
be angry when he saw you. Aren’t you
afraid?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the colonel,” Hadley replied,
smiling up at her. He remembered the
anxiety in her countenance when he had
last seen her looking from the inn window
as he ran with the dispatches to escape the
dragoons, and he was not so much afraid of
her as he had been earlier in their acquaintance.
“He wasn’t very pleasant, but
the dragoons aren’t in the neighborhood
now and I guess he won’t try to do anything
to me. You see, m’am, most of the
farmers are on my side.”</p>

<p>“You are a terrible rebel!” declared the
girl, but she still smiled down upon him.
“Did you carry those dispatches ’way to&mdash;to
that Mr. Washington whom your
people call ‘general’?”</p>

<p>“I went all the way with them and saw
General Washington himself,” declared the
boy, proudly. “He is a mighty fine gentleman,
and the place where he stops was full
of officers. All the American army are not
ragamuffins,” and his eyes twinkled as he
thus reminded her of her criticism of the
American soldiery on a previous occasion.
“Some of the colonists know how to fight
as well as hired soldiers.”</p>

<p>“And some of them know how to run,”
Lillian cried.</p>

<p>“True. Would you have had me stand
here and face that whole mob of dragoons&mdash;to
say nothing of your father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean you. I think you
were very smart to get away on that horse
with the dispatches. And I’ll tell you what
father said about it,” she added, lowering
her voice and glancing about her. “He
said that ‘if the rebel youth can fight so
well and are such strategists, it is no wonder
that my Lord Howe and the other
generals have so little luck in bringing the
uprising to a swift close.’ Now, aren’t you
proud?”</p>

<p>Hadley flushed as she spoke. “I thought
he was very angry with me this morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think he is angry enough; but
he seemed to admire your ability to beat the
dragoons and get across the river as you
did. I heard him and the officer in command
of the troopers talking about it, and
they both wondered how you escaped them
on the road to the ferry. Father said he
had almost caught you&mdash;he could tell by
the sound of your horse’s feet&mdash;when the
sound suddenly stopped and you disappeared
as though the earth had opened and
swallowed you. How did you do it?”</p>

<p>“You are an enemy,” the boy returned,
with amusement. “I couldn’t tell you that,
you know. Anything else&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell me what sort of a man that uncle
of yours, Ephraim Morris, is?” she broke
in, suddenly. “I spoke to father about
him and he said he must be the man he has
come here to see.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Ephraim is an old man. He
came from England years ago. He isn’t
liked very well. He’s a king’s man, you
know&mdash;a Tory.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s something in his favor,” she
declared.</p>

<p>“So I thought you’d say,” he replied,
shouldering his rake and broom and preparing
to return to the stableyard. “I
didn’t want you to have too bad an opinion
of Uncle Ephraim.”</p>

<p>“If he is the person my father is looking
for I have a very bad opinion of him, indeed,
and his being for the king will make
little difference one way or another.”</p>

<p>Her words disturbed Hadley when he
thought them over. Mistress Lillian had
seemed well disposed towards him personally,
but she was also bitter against his
uncle, and Hadley believed Uncle Ephraim
should have warning of the colonel’s visit.
So, immediately after his duties at the Three
Oaks were performed, Hadley set out to
his uncle’s house.</p>

<p>The Morris pastures were the nearest to
the Three Oaks Inn, and crossing the road
where he had so fortunately escaped the
dragoons by the aid of Lafe Holdness,
Hadley struck into the open plain on
which his uncle’s cattle grazed.</p>

<p>The big pasture was dotted with clumps
of trees, and while yet Hadley was some
distance from the farmhouse and its neighboring
buildings, he saw a band of young
stock stampeding wildly from the vicinity
of a grove of dwarfed oaks not far away.
The cattle, heads down and tails in the air,
plunged across the plain at a mad pace,
and Hadley was positive that they were not
running without cause. The drove passed
him like a whirlwind, and in their wake
came a loudly-yelping cur and a person
whom he very well knew, urging the dog
on.</p>

<p>“Hold on there! what are you about?”
cried Hadley, running forward. “What
are you chasing the cattle for? That brute
of yours will kill some of the stock.”</p>

<p>It was Lon Alwood, and it was quite
evident by Lon’s expression of countenance
that Hadley was the last person he had expected
to meet just then. “Wh&mdash;why, I
thought you had gone to join the army!”
he gasped.</p>

<p>“I’m right here to tell you to stop chasing
my uncle’s cattle,” returned Hadley, in disgust.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are, hey?” cried the other boy,
with bravado. Then, to the cur who had
halted like his master at the appearance of
Hadley: “Sic ’em, boy&mdash;sic ’em!”</p>

<p>Hadley grabbed a clod, and as the dog
started after the fleeing steers he hurled
the lump of earth with considerable force
and it bounded resoundingly from the
canine’s ribs. The brute gave a yelp and
took refuge behind its master, its interest
for the moment lost in the inoffensive cattle.
There it crouched and growled at Hadley,
while Lon fairly danced up and down in
his rage.</p>

<p>“What you need, Had Morris, is a sound
thrashing, and I’m going to give it to you
right now!” declared the young Tory.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t try any thrashing, if I were
you, Lon. You know you tried it once, a
long time ago, and I haven’t forgotten how
to wrestle since then.”</p>

<p>Hadley tried to pass on as he spoke, but
young Alwood sprang before him and
barred his way. “You’re going to get
thrashed right here and now, Had Morris!”
declared he, resentfully. “You haven’t got
any gun or pistol to help you out, and I’m
not afraid of you. So look out for yourself!”</p>

<p>Hadley saw no way of avoiding the
struggle unless he took to his heels, and he
could not bring himself to do that. So he
met his antagonist’s charge to the best of
his ability, and in a moment they were
locked together in a close, but far from
loving, embrace, while the dog ran around
and around them, barking its approval of
its master’s conduct.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
UNCLE EPHRAIM DISPLAYS GREAT INTEREST</h3>
  </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE boys had scarcely gripped each
other when Lon realized that he was
now no better able to cope with his
rival in a wrestling bout than he was at
their last encounter, months previous. The
stableboy of the Three Oaks Inn had been
in perfect training every day of his active
life. Lon was lazy, and had to be fairly
driven to work by his father. He would
much rather roam the woods with a gun and
dog, or go fishing, than do those tasks which
fell to the share of the other lads of the
neighborhood, and leaping and running, and
frolicking with his friends in their off-hours,
had not hardened his muscles as Hadley’s
toil hardened his.</p>

<p>The latter obtained a good hold on his
enemy and, with a sudden squeeze, almost
drove the breath out of Lon’s lungs. The
Tory youth gasped as he felt this sudden
strength. “Oh! oh!” he groaned. And
then, kicking frantically and endeavoring to
beat his antagonist in the face with his
fists, cried aloud to the excited dog: “Sic
’im, sir! Go at ’im!”</p>

<p>The mongrel, as cruel as its master,
plunged into the fray and grabbed at Hadley’s
leg. Fortunately, the stableboy wore
high riding boots, and instead of seizing
the calf of his leg, the brute sunk its teeth
in the leather. The attack, however,
brought Hadley to the ground, with the
dog chewing at the bootleg and snarling,
and Lon Alwood on top. But the under
boy still hugged his human antagonist
tightly to him, and for the moment his
brute enemy did little harm.</p>

<p>All the time Lon was encouraging the
dog in his attack, but
Hadley would not
strike him. “Call off
the beast and fight fair,
Alwood!” he said.
“Call him off and try it
over again. This is no
fair game.”</p>

<p>Lon’s only answer
was a more desperate
attempt to get his arms
free and so strike his
enemy with more precision.
But the unequal
contest was exhausting
Hadley’s
strength, and he knew
he could not keep his
advantage for long.
So, putting forth all his
remaining energy, he
suddenly rolled Lon
over and came uppermost
himself. The dog
yelped loudly and let
go the boot, for Hadley
had managed to
give him a well-placed
kick at the same moment,
and while the
brute was recovering
from this the boy broke
away from Lon and
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>The dog seeing its
master on the ground,
growled savagely and
leaped for Hadley
again&mdash;this time for
his throat. But the
boy was ready for the attack, and the toe
of his riding boot caught the animal under
the jaw and sent it backward with terrific
force. Lon had secured his footing, too,
and seeing his canine friend so badly
treated, came at Hadley with redoubled
fury. The latter caught him at arms’
length and before Lon could secure any
hold, threw him forcibly to the ground.</p>

<p>The dog happened to be in the way and
his master fell flat upon him and with sufficient
force to break the animal’s spine.
The dog’s almost humanlike cry of agony
shocked Hadley, and his anger was gone in
an instant. “Oh, the poor creature!” he
cried, and as Lon got up, bleeding at the
nose and much bruised, Hadley knelt down
beside the beast to see how badly it was
hurt. But with a few spasmodic jerks of
its limbs the dog lay still; its master’s fall
had killed it.</p>

<p>Alwood, however, little interested in the
death of the faithful creature, was searching
about the pasture, and suddenly finding a
smooth cobble, hurled it with all his might
at the kneeling boy. Fortunately, Hadley
turned in time to see the action and dodge
the stone. He leaped up, and Lon turned
tail and ran to escape merited punishment
for this cowardly act.</p>

<p>“That fellow hasn’t a spark of honor,”
thought the victor of this rather sanguinary
encounter. “He can’t fight fair. I’m sorry
I killed his dog; but I don’t believe Lon
thought of the poor brute at all. He was
just mad at me and cared nothing about it.
I’ll have to watch out for Lon Alwood, for
he’ll seek to injure me without giving fair
warning, I know.”</p>

<p>His encounter with the Tory youth had
detained him, until now it was growing
dusk along the edges of the wood which
bordered the pasture. He hurried on and
soon arrived at the outbuildings and barns
belonging to his uncle. The cattle had
come up to the barnyard and the cows were
being milked by the hired hands, while
Ephraim overlooked the feeding. If the
old gentleman deprived himself of everything
but the bare necessities of life, he was
careful that his stock was well fed.</p>

<p>The men were mostly lads from neighboring
farms, who went home at night,
working for their monthly wage for Master
Morris because there was not enough to
do to keep them busy at home. They cordially
greeted the miser’s nephew, for
though they were nearly all from Tory
families, Hadley was popular with them.
Ephraim Morris, however, had but a cold
welcome for the stableboy.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, in an unpleasant voice,
“what have you got to say for yourself,
Hadley?”</p>

<p>“About what, uncle?” demanded the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard all about it. I let you
work for that innkeeper and this is what it
comes to, hey? I thought so&mdash;I thought so!
Hanging around a place like that would
spoil anybody’s morals. I’m surprised at
you, Hadley&mdash;and your mother was a good
woman. And for you, who were born a
British subject on English soil yourself, to
help these crazy colonists along&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I believe they are right, uncle, just
as you believe the king and the king’s men
are right.”</p>

<p>“Pah! pah!” exclaimed the old man,
savagely. “What does a boy like you
know of such matters? You have hung
about that Jonas Benson, and his inn, which
is a hotbed of rebellion, so long that you
talk like a lawyer. It is ruining you, and
I won’t have a nephew of mine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But Master Benson pays you my wages
regularly, doesn’t he?” demanded Hadley,
before the old man could say anything rash.</p>

<p>“Hem&mdash;well, I can say he does,” admitted
Uncle Ephraim, and subsided for a
moment. Soon, however, he started on a
new tack. “Who is this English officer
who is a guest at the inn, nephew?” he
asked. “It is said that he is a great man
from York way. And to think that you
should oppose a gentleman and an officer
of His Majesty’s army!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how great a man he is,”
Hadley returned. “He calls himself Colonel
Creston Knowles&mdash;”</p>

<p>The old man started and leaned forward
so that his wrinkled face came within the
candlelight. Wonder, and an expression
which seemed like fear, slowly grew upon
his countenance. “Who did you say he
was?” he demanded, his lean fingers clutching
the edge of the table.</p>

<p>“Colonel Creston Knowles, uncle. His
daughter, Mistress Lillian, is with him.
They have come into Jersey to find a family
by our name, I understand. Both of them
have asked me about you, sir.” While he
said this, Hadley scrutinized Uncle Ephraim
closely. The old man was much disturbed,
for he sat silent for several minutes
and his face showed plainly that he
was the man Colonel Knowles was so
anxious to see. “Who is Colonel
Knowles?” the boy asked, at length.
“What does he want to see you for? Is he&mdash;is
he related to us in any way?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” snarled the miser. “He’s
nothing to either you or me. I&mdash;I don’t
know him&mdash;I don’t know him, I tell you!
Now, go to bed, and don’t disturb me
with your questions.”</p>

<p>Hadley cleared up the untidy kitchen as
best he could, and then lit a tallow dip at
the single candle on the table, and obeyed
his uncle’s behest by mounting the stairs to
the loft over the room. He went to bed at
once, for he was tired enough, but he could
not sleep for thinking of his uncle’s strange
manner and words. There was some
mysterious connection between Colonel
Knowles and the Morrises; but Uncle Ephraim
did not intend to admit it.</p>

<p>Hadley fell into a doze at last, but only
for a short time. The squeak of a door below
aroused him, and after listening a moment
and fancying all sort of noises, as one
will in the night when the house is still, he
crept out of bed, slipped on his outer clothes
again, and tiptoed to the head of the stairs
to see if his uncle had himself gone to bed.
There was a faint light below, and the boy
was confident that the candle must be burning,
for Uncle Ephraim would never leave
a fire on the hearth at this time of the year.</p>

<p>Carefully going down several steps in
perfect silence, he managed to get a view of
the whole kitchen, including the fireplace,
and what was his astonishment to see
Ephraim Morris standing upon a chair before
an old brick oven built high in the
chimney, and which Hadley never remembered
seeing opened before. It was open
now, however, and the old gentleman had
his head and shoulders thrust inside, as
though reaching for something concealed
at the extreme back of the oven.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
A MIDNIGHT BURYING</h3>
  </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>O play the rôle of eavesdropper, or
“Peeping Tom,” was not exactly as
Hadley Morris would have wished.
He hated a sneak; but his curiosity regarding
his uncle’s manœuvres was for the time
too strong for his ideas of what was really
honorable, and instead of retreating up the
stairs to the loft again, he remained where
he was and watched the old gentleman with
wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>Like most substantially built houses of
that day, the Morris homestead had a
great stone and brick fireplace built into the
end wall. To the right of the fireplace was
one of those ovens in which the pioneer
housewives did all their baking. The oven
was like a safe built into the side of the
chimney, and had a smooth clay floor.
Uncle Ephraim had always kept the oven
door fastened with an old-fashioned brass
padlock.</p>

<p>The padlock now lay on the floor, and as
Hadley continued to peer into the wide
kitchen from around the corner of the door-frame,
he saw Master Morris draw back
from the mouth of the oven, holding a bag
in each hand. The bags were not large,
but by the way his uncle carried them the
boy knew they were heavy, and when the
old man stepped down from the chair and
laid them on the table, the listener heard
a faint chink as though of metal. “It’s
gold!” whispered the boy to himself, and
his eyes opened even more widely at the
thought.</p>

<p>Then for the first time Hadley saw that
Master Morris wore his waistcoat and coat,
as though he were ready to go out of doors.
He put on his hat at once, stuck the half-burned
candle in a lantern, and with the
latter swung over his arm and one of
the heavy bags in each hand, he left the
house.</p>

<p>Hadley hesitated only a moment; then,
curiosity still spurring him, he ran lightly
down the remaining steps into the kitchen
and followed his uncle out of doors without
stopping for his own hat. The night was
mild and not at all dark, but the boy might
have found some difficulty in following the
old man had it not been for the flickering
lantern which swung from his arm. This
dancing will-o’-the-wisp led the boy down
behind the barns and cribs and directly into
the orchard where the branches of the
gnarled old apple trees met and, with their
fruit and foliage, shut out most of the star-light.</p>

<p>Hadley crept near, cautiously, when he
saw that Uncle Ephraim had halted and set
the light upon the ground. Soon he discovered
that the old man had been here before
since he went to bed, for there was a
shovel and a heap of earth in plain view.
He watched his uncle and saw him drop
the two bags into what appeared to be a
rather deep hole, then place a flat stone on
top of them, and afterward fill in the hole
with the soil and stamp it all down with
care. There was considerable soil left then,
and the old man carried this away, shovelful
by shovelful, and threw it into a ditch at the
far edge of the orchard. Afterward he replaced
the sod which he had earlier removed,
patting it all down evenly with the
flat of his shovel. The burying was completed,
and marking the spot well for future
reference, Hadley ran back to the house
and climbed to the loft, and was nicely in
bed again before the old man returned to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>But the strangeness of the whole matter
kept the boy awake long after he was sure
his uncle had sought his own couch. He
was unable to compose his mind to sleep,
and was glad when at length the cocks
crew to announce the gray light in the east.
He rose and went back to the Three Oaks
without again seeing Uncle Ephraim, and
tried to forget the incident of the night in
his work about the inn. But when he saw
Colonel Creston Knowles ride off with William
toward the Morris farm soon after
breakfast, Hadley wished he had remained
longer with his uncle, and so been present
at the interview which was about to take
place between the old man and the British
officer.</p>

<p>Lillian avoided him that day, seemingly,
and Hadley went about his duties with
much trouble at his heart. It was after
noon when Colonel Knowles and his henchman
returned, and a glance at the officer’s
face told Hadley that the gentleman was in
a towering rage. Evidently his visit had
afforded him little satisfaction.</p>

<p>Soon, however, something occurred
which succeeded in driving this mystery
into the background of the boy’s mind.
News from Philadelphia had been scarce
since his return from the Pennsylvania side
of the river; but after supper that evening
a man rode up to the inn on a fagged-out
horse, and told them that the army under
Washington was on the move, and was
marching toward Philadelphia, as it was
believed Lord Howe’s fleet would land
troops to attack the city, where Congress
was then in session. The man obtained a
fresh mount and rode on into the east,
having secret business in that direction.</p>

<p>That night, while Jonas Benson and
Hadley sat together in the chimney place of
the inn kitchen, talking over the possibilities
of the battle which must occur before
long, the heralding squeak of Lafe
Holdness’ wagon axles reached their ears,
the outer door being ajar.</p>

<p>“Run and open the gate for him, Had!”
exclaimed Benson. “Mistress, put down
something to eat for a hungry man, and I
warrant you Lafe will do justice to it.”</p>

<p>His wife grumblingly expressed herself
that a cold supper was good enough for a
man like Lafe Holdness; but she, nevertheless,
obeyed her husband’s request.</p>

<p>“Stan’ round ther, you!” From the yard
the teamster’s voice could be heard addressing
the horses. “Ef ye want suthin’ ter
eat, why don’t ye stan’ still so’t I kin unbuckle
this strap? Hello, Had Morris!
is that air yeou? I didn’t ’spect to see yeou
ag’in this side o’ the river till the war was
over,” and the Yankee chuckled mightily
and dug the boy good-naturedly in the
ribs.</p>

<p>“We heard to-night the army was on the
move, Lafe,” Jonas said, coming to the
porch, and speaking low.</p>

<p>Lafe dropped for the moment his bantering
tone and spoke seriously. “There’s
going to be something done purty soon,
friends&mdash;somethin’ big! There’s sure to be
a battle. Howe’s fleet is comin’ up Chesapeake
Bay and General Washington will
meet the troops he lands somewhere south
of Philadelphia; but we ain’t got much
more’n ten thousand men all told.”</p>

<p>“How many sailed from York?” queried
the innkeeper.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows!” returned Lafe, ruefully.
“Them dispatches Had took over
ter Germantown didn’t give the exact figgers.
But I’m out this way sendin’ in all
the scatterin’ men that hev’ got guns.
There won’t much happen hereabout until
the two armies meet. And, speakin’
about Had,” added Lafe, suddenly, “I’m
wantin’ ter use him, Jonas.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the innkeeper, with
twinkling eyes, “he’s a pretty valuable boy to
me. I have to pay his uncle for him, too.”</p>

<p>“You’d oughter be called Judas Benson!”
declared the Yankee. “You’re a
great feller ter haggle over the price of a
’prentice boy. I’m goin’ ter send him to
the army&mdash;it’s at Philadelphia now.”</p>

<p>“And that means I’ll likely lose a good
horse as well as the boy,” grumbled Jonas.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I’ve got anything to
say about it myself?” demanded Hadley of
the Yankee.</p>

<p>“Not much. I’ve got orders for you,”
he declared, nodding his head. “See here.”
He drew a battered wallet from his pocket,
and in the light of the innkeeper’s lantern
selected a slip of paper from one of the
compartments. This he displayed before
the wondering eyes of both Jonas and
Hadley. On the paper was written, in a
rather cramped and formal hand:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Send back the boy from the Three Oaks
Inn with any message.</p>
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap right">Cadwalader.</span>”</p>
  </div>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed the round-eyed innkeeper, “that’s the man who saved
you from the soldiers, Had--Colonel Cadwalader.”</p>

<p>“I reckon ye’ must ha’ got purty thick
with Master Cadwalader, Had,” said
Lafe, tearing the paper into small pieces.
“Let me tell yeou he is in the General’s
confidence as much as old Knox, or Colonel
Pickering. I got suthin’ important for
yeou to take to headquarters, an’ if yeou’ve
had your supper yeou’d better saddle a
hoss an’ git away with it purty soon. The
quicker ye start the sooner ye’ll ketch the
army, for it’s on the move.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Jonas Benson
was already leading Black Molly out of her
stall, showing at once that his objections to
the boy’s departure had been but momentary.
“He’s had his supper, and he can git
out right now!” he declared.</p>

<p>But Hadley waited long enough to go
into the loft and put on the best suit of
homespun which he possessed, and encased
his legs in long riding boots with a
pair of tiny spurs screwed into the heels.
There were no papers to take this time, for
Lafe Holdness whispered the message he
had to send into the boy’s attentive ear.
“An’ now good luck to ye!” exclaimed the
scout as the youth mounted into the saddle
and Jonas opened the stable door. “Nobody
can take nothin’ from ye this time,
but mebbe it’s just as well if yeou dodge
all armed men of airy complection till ye
pass Germantown.”</p>

<p>Black Molly trotted quietly down the inn
yard toward the gate. Just as she was
going through this and her rider was about
to give her the rein, he was startled by a
soft “S-s-st!” beside him. He turned his
head quickly and drew Molly down to a
walk. A shadowy figure stood at the end
of the porch. In an instant Hadley recognized
Lillian Knowles, with a light shawl
flung over her head and shoulders, and her
hand outstretched to him.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_a-figure-stood.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A FIGURE STOOD AT THE END OF THE PORCH</div>
</div>

<p>“Hadley Morris!” she whispered, “if you
are carrying anything&mdash;anything you don’t
want other folks to see&mdash;look out! There
are others beside me who know you are
riding toward the ferry to-night.” And
then, before he could reply or express his
astonishment at her warning, she disappeared
within the shadow of the porch. He
heard the door close softly behind her, and,
after a moment’s hesitation, he started
Molly on again and turned her head
toward the distant ferry, wondering if he
ought to take the girl’s words seriously
and turn back for reinforcements.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A sharp, imperative rat-a-tat-tat on the
class-room door almost at her back startled
the speaker, Sidney Dallas. She turned
for an instant, but that instant was enough
to scatter her wits like chaff before the wind.
She paused&mdash;stammered&mdash;paused again,
then repeated vaguely:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We called&mdash;we called them the kid-gloved Dandy Fifth</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We called&mdash;we called&mdash;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the words would not be coaxed back.
Her mind was a perfect blank. She was so
confused that she did not see that the visitor
who was being ushered in by Bess
Martin, and whose sharp knock had so disconcerted
her, was her own mother.</p>

<p>A hot flush of shame scorched her face,
the crowd of attentive faces before her began
to waver, her knees grew weak, her
feet cowardly, but she made one more brave
effort:</p>

<p>“We called&mdash;we called”&mdash;she repeated
weakly and hurriedly, then stopped short.</p>

<p>“But it would not come,” murmured
mischievous Ted Scott, lugubriously. Ted
had been crowded to the front seat, which
he shared with two other boys. The boys
snickered, and Sidney’s misery was complete.
Never before had she failed in a
speech, or realized the humiliation.</p>

<p>All a-tremble she stepped off the platform,
and with scarlet face and tearful eyes
passed down the aisle between the double
row of visitors, whose looks of sympathy
her distorted imagination turned into looks
of derision at her distress. But the tears
should not fall, and she would not lower
her head. As she reached her seat she
caught a look of amusement on the face of
Myrtle Emmons, who sat at the desk immediately
behind her own. It was that
that gave her the bit over her runaway self-possession.
Myrtle was somewhat noted
for making fun of people. She would
show Myrtle how little she cared.</p>

<p>Disregarding Myrtle’s nudge, she concentrated
her attention upon the beautifully
decorated school-room. It had been transformed
into a veritable bower, not with
boughs of pine and cedar as in the Eastern
States, but with fragrant branches of catalpa
with their great clusters of snowy blossoms
and with immense sprays of feathery asparagus.
The platform, as well as the teacher’s
desk at the back of it, was banked with
potted ferns and palms and flowering plants.
The beribboned waste-basket formed a
huge bouquet of feathery greenery, amidst
which tall, graceful sunflowers bowed their
golden heads. That artistic touch was her
own, and she gazed at it with pride. Sunflowers
and asparagus adorned the pictures
and caught up the folds of the large flag
draped gracefully over the front blackboard,
and of the bright bunting festooned
around the walls.</p>

<p>Flags and sunflowers, sunflowers and
flags&mdash;a combination so popular that she
should always associate the golden emblem-flower
of her State with the glorious emblem
of her country. They had devoted
more time than usual to their decorations,
for, the following Monday being Memorial
Day, they had turned their “last day” exercises
into a memorial service. Owing to
the naval victory of scarce a month previous,
patriotism was at a white heat, and
patriotic selections of spirit shared the
honors with tributes to the dead&mdash;both the
Blue and the Gray, sectionalism being forgotten
in the new union of the North and
the South.</p>

<p>But it did not require recent victory to
stir Sidney’s enthusiasm; she was at all
times intensely patriotic. As a small child,
a mere babe, she had listened enthralled to
her father’s tales of the Civil War, through
many of whose terrible battles he had
passed. She invariably chose patriotic
selections to speak. Such a deed as described
in the “Dandy Fifth” made her forget
herself. And now, of all times, to fail
to-day! The school were singing softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cover them over&mdash;yes, cover them over&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Parent and husband, and brother, and lover:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crown in your hearts those dead heroes of ours.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cover them over with beautiful flowers.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How she would love to lay a tribute of
flowers upon the graves of the Dandy
Fifth’s many dead heroes! And, oh,
shame! she had failed to give them even the
tribute of honor due them&mdash;failed miserably!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lying so silent by night and by day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleeping the years of their manhood away.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That meant the most of the Dandy Fifth.
She could see the gaunt, silent forms, fallen
at their posts in that awful hour that “tried
men’s souls.” But theirs stood the test&mdash;stood
it grandly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Swiftly they rushed to the help of the right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firmly they stood in the shock of the fight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Stood firm&mdash;firm? Did they not? Why,
they made a glorious stand&mdash;none braver
in all the war, none more deserving of
honor!&mdash;and she had left them with their
courage unproven, with the scorn of their
comrades upon them, before they had been
given a chance to make their derisive
epithet a name to be proud of for all time.
Oh, she could not bear it! she could not
bear it! She must save the honor of the
Dandy Fifth.</p>

<p>The thought was electric. It shocked
into full life the resolve already half formed
in her mind. Hastening up to Miss Mason
she whispered a request, which was smilingly
granted. With a bright face Sidney hurried
from the room just as the next number
was called. She meant to go home, find
the poem, then come back and redeem herself.
She had but three blocks to go, and
that distance was covered with flying feet.
To her dismay she found the door locked.
Of course, her mother meant to attend the
exercises. No doubt she was in the room
all the time, and had witnessed her failure.
But&mdash;she must get in. She looked for the
key in its customary hiding-place when all
the family were expected to be absent at
once; it was not there. Recent petty thieving
in the neighborhood had probably induced
Mrs. Dallas to take the key with
her.</p>

<p>Sidney was dismayed. She rushed from
door to door, and from window to window.
All were securely fastened. She sat down
on the porch to think a moment. Perhaps
she could get in through an upper window;
she had left her own window, which, fortunately,
was over the kitchen, lowered
slightly and the screen unlatched. She
could reach the spring through the opening,
lower it still more, then crawl through.
Desperation lent her strength to drag the
long, heavy ladder from the barn and to
raise it to the low kitchen roof. A moment
later she pattered over the flat tin roof
to the window&mdash;only to find further evidence
of her mother’s caution. It was
closed and latched.</p>

<p>Then, in spite of her courageous soul and
her fifteen years, Sidney gave up to a tearful
despair for a few minutes. Down upon
the tin roof she sat, huddled close up in the
corner, and, bowing her head upon her
knees, wept silent tears of mortification.
The thought that she would have to leave
the Dandy Fifth unhonored brought forth
the bitterest drops of all.</p>

<p>But&mdash;they did not give up. Neither
would she. Something must be done.
She would go back to the school-house
and get the key, come back and get the
book, then return and save the day for the
Dandy Fifth if possible.</p>

<p>It was a very tired, hot-faced girl that
labored up the second flight of stairs at
the school-house. As she paused for
breath a moment in the upper hall she heard
Rob Ellison stentoriously depicting “Sheridan’s
Ride.” In the room across the hall
the “Fifth Graders” were singing “Sherman’s
March to the Sea,” and farther on
the “Sixths” were sending out a vigorous
chorus of the “Star-Spangled Banner.”
Passing into the library, a small room just
across the hall, she sat down to cool off,
and at the same time to work up sufficient
courage to face the crowded room in
search of her mother. She didn’t want to
disconcert another speaker by knocking on
the door in order to call her mother out.
She glanced around the room. Right there
in that corner was where she stood when
she rehearsed the “Dandy Fifth” to the
elocution teacher.</p>

<p>Mechanically Sidney placed herself in the
accustomed position, and half unconsciously
began to recite the poem in a low
tone. To her amazement and delight she
went through it without a break. Whether
it was the effect of association, or whether
her recreant memory had suddenly chosen
to return, she neither questioned nor cared,
she was so overjoyed. She tried it again,
then a third time, all unconscious of an
interested listener beyond the closed door&mdash;Prof.
Marlow, who stood there smiling
to himself as the speaker’s voice rose
higher and higher with returning confidence.</p>

<p>As Sidney finished with a triumphant
flourish, he clapped his hands softly, then
opened the door to remark smilingly. “Well
done, Miss Sidney. Now, rally to the
charge again, and march on to victory.”</p>

<p>Sidney blushed: she knew he had witnessed
her failure. She felt that explanations
were in order.</p>

<p>Prof. Marlow held up a warning finger.
“At the eleventh hour, Miss Sidney,” he
said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“It’s the twelfth hour that tells,” she retorted
merrily, and passed into the school-room.
Prof. Marlow followed her. He
was curious to see how such a plucky effort
would turn out.</p>

<p>Sidney was met with many swift glances
as she entered, but her radiant face showed
no trace of her recent failure. A few moments
later she again faced the many expectant
eyes, now no longer dreaded. No
sudden rat-a-tat-tat could scatter her wits
again&mdash;no, not even a cannon’s roar, for
the Dandy Fifth’s honor was at stake. The
audience greeted her enthusiastically. It
is human nature to admire courage even in
small things. Self was forgotten; every
thought and feeling was centred on the
subject in hand&mdash;that famous regiment of
young aristocrats, men who knew not
toil, who had never suffered want or endured
hardship, whose fastidiousness fastened
upon them the scornful epithet, “The
Dandy Fifth.”</p>

<p>Her listeners saw it all: the old fort
“somewhere down on the Rapidan” that
the Dandy Fifth was ordered to hold; the
fierce onslaught of the enemy along the
whole line; the raging of battle day after
day; how gloriously the old fort, the “key
of the whole line,” on which hung the fate
of the whole army, was held by the Dandy
Fifth against all odds&mdash;a brave, determined
foe without and starvation within. The
water gave out; they fought on. Another
day, and their rations were gone;
they fought on. One by one, they
sank to “rest where they wearied and
lie where they fell.” A third day of
fierce siege&mdash;a fourth, then reinforcements
fought their way through, inch by inch, to
the beleaguered men. And what a sight
met their gaze!&mdash;a few gaunt-eyed men behind
the guns, and many, many more lying
as they fell, in the stupor of famine or
ghastly and rigid in death. But the old
flag floated still!&mdash;and the “kid-gloved
Dandy Fifth” had proved that white hands
are not incompatible with brave hearts.
How their old comrades cheered!&mdash;and
cheered! And how proud they were to
clasp those brave, emaciated white hands!</p>

<p>Sidney’s little head might well have been
turned by praise had it been that kind of
a head, she received so many words of commendation.
Ted Scott led the applause,
and it was his hands that gave the final appreciative
clap. Even Myrtle Emmons
congratulated her. “It was grand, Sid,”
she said, earnestly. “But how could you
ever do it after breaking down once? I
never could, and I always break down. I
was awfully sorry for you, for, you see, I
know how it goes. But, say, Sid! I thought
I couldn’t help laughing as you came
down the aisle; old Mrs. Perkins stalked
along right behind you, her battered bonnet
over one ear as usual, and that ancient,
solitary, stiff, bedraggled, black feather
sticking straight up. I always have to
laugh when I see it, though, of course, I
oughtn’t.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” returned Sidney, with sudden
cordiality. So she had misjudged Myrtle,
after all.</p>

<p>“But how could you do it?” persisted
Myrtle.</p>

<p>Then out came the whole story, even to
the tears, and they had a merry time over it.</p>

<p>“And to think that I was the cause of it,”
laughed Mrs. Dallas. “But I am glad my
little girl was brave enough to turn defeat
into victory.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was really I, mamma,”
said Sidney, slowly and thoughtfully. “It
was the Dandy Fifth.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
A TRYING AFTERNOON</h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Polly Prentiss is an orphan who, for the greater
part of her life, has lived with a distant relative,
Mrs. Manser, the mistress of Manser Farm. Miss
Hetty Pomeroy, a maiden lady of middle age, has,
ever since the death of her favorite niece, been on
the lookout for a little girl whom she might adopt.
She is attracted by Polly’s appearance and quaint
manners, and finally decides to take her home and
keep her for a month’s trial. In the foregoing
chapters, Polly has arrived at her new home, and
the great difference between the way of living at
Pomeroy Oaks and her past life affords her much
food for wonderment.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">“S</span>O you like your new friends, my
dear,” said Miss Hetty. “They
must be banished to the shed now
for their dinner while you and I eat ours.
Do you hear Arctura’s signal to us?”</p>

<p>There came a sound unlike anything
Polly had ever heard; it was not exactly a
bell; she couldn’t imagine what it was.
Miss Hetty held out her hand with a smile,
and Polly, still with Snip and Snap on her
shoulders, was led out of the library, across
the porch hall to a big, sunny dining-room.
On the table, at Miss Hetty’s place, stood
a strange thing with three bronze cups upside
down, a little one highest up, one
somewhat larger under it, and one still
larger at the bottom; at least that was the
way it looked to Polly.</p>

<p>Arctura stood close to it with a little
stick in her hand; she struck the bronze
cups as Polly looked at her, and again the
musical sound was heard.</p>

<p>“There, I reckoned you’d never heard
anything like that!” said Arctura as she
beamed on Polly, and then took the kittens
from the little girl’s shoulders. “That’s a
heathen invention, called a gong, brought
to Miss Pomeroy by her Uncle Pete. I
hope you’ll relish your food; I’ve got no
time to sit down now,” said Arctura, and
bearing Snip and Snap in her arms she
marched out of a doorway through which
there was a glimpse of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Arctura Green had never sat at the table
with Miss Pomeroy in all the years of her
faithful service, but it was understood to be
purely a matter of choice on her part, and
a few words were spoken now and then to
make this state of affairs clear to any
chance visitor.</p>

<p>Polly ate her steak and potato and fresh
bread and butter, sitting opposite Miss
Pomeroy, and only speaking in answer to
questions. She looked at the spotless
white table-cloth with its rose and fern
pattern, at the shining glass tumblers, and
the big glass water bottle, at the fat silver
tea-pot and sugar-bowl, and the slender
spoons and forks, at the knives, with
mother-of-pearl handles, at the white plates
with dull blue figures that matched those
on the platter, and at the big bread plate
with its gold rim. Then she looked at the
buffet on which there were all sorts of
shining things.</p>

<p>“It is because everything is so wonderful
in the house that they like to stay here
better than out-doors,” thought Polly, but
in spite of everything her eyes turned wistfully
to the window. The sunshine flickered
and danced among the branches of the
Pomeroy oaks, and Polly gave a half sigh
as she looked at it.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like your pudding, my dear?”
asked Miss Hetty, and the little girl turned
quickly to her dinner again.</p>

<p>After dinner she followed Miss Pomeroy
up the broad, shallow front stairs to the
pretty room which had been prepared for
her. It had a white bed, a white bureau, a
white wash-stand, two little straight-backed
white chairs, and a white rocking-chair.
A pink stripe ran through the white near
the edges of all these pieces of furniture,
and Polly thought it was the most beautiful
bed-room that could possibly be imagined.</p>

<p>“And here is your closet,” said Miss
Hetty, as she opened a door, and showed
what seemed to Polly like a good-sized
room, with shelves and hooks. On the
lowest shelf sat the big black enamel cloth
bag, looking old and forlorn.</p>

<p>“Now, you’d better take out your things
and put them away in the closet and the
bureau, Mary,” said Miss Hetty, “and perhaps
you’d like to lie down and rest awhile;
I am going to take my nap now. When
you wish to go downstairs you may, but
I wouldn’t run out to-day, for the ground is
so damp. I dare say you’ll find plenty to
amuse you in the house, and you are free
to go anywhere. I’m sure I can trust such
a careful, quiet little girl as you are.”</p>

<p>When the door that led into Miss Pomeroy’s
room across the hall was fairly shut,
Polly executed a silent dance on the soft
gray and pink carpet.</p>

<p>“I guess Mrs. Manser’d think I was
doing pretty well,” said Polly, thrilling with
pride. “I never was called ‘quiet’ or ‘careful’
before. She’d hardly believe it. I
must be growing like Eleanor pretty fast.
As soon as I’ve put away my things I shall
lie right down on that bed. I wonder how
long I ought to stay on it. I suppose most
probably Eleanor would stay till she heard
her aunt getting up; that’s what I’ll do.
Mrs. Manser said most likely Miss Pomeroy
would give me tests. I shall lie on
that bed till I hear Miss Pomeroy if
its&mdash;two hours,” said Polly, firmly, mentioning
the longest space of time which she
could conceive might be spent in sleeping
by daylight.</p>

<p>Then Polly took the big bag out of the
closet and proceeded to unpack it. There
was her other new gingham frock on top
of everything else; it had blue and white
stripes, and was very pretty, Polly thought,
as she laid it carefully away in the lowest
of the four bureau drawers. Then came
her little brown cashmere frock, made over
from one which had done service for six
years as Mrs. Manser’s Sunday gown; it
was Polly’s Sunday best now, very brave
with a little red piping around the neck and
sleeves, and at the head of the ruffle. This
Polly hung in the closet.</p>

<p>In the closet, too, went a very old and
much-mended red frock which was always
nearly hidden by long-sleeved and high-necked
aprons. There were four of these,
and two more new ones without sleeves.
Polly was so small that there had been
plenty of room in the big bag for all these
things and for the little store of underclothes
which went into the third drawer.
The aprons had the second drawer to
themselves, and in the top drawer there
were Polly’s small handkerchiefs and one
pair of little white cotton gloves, freshly
washed.</p>

<p>Polly took the bag back to the closet
after removing the very last thing, her work
basket, which she put on the bureau, beside
the fat pincushion. Looking at this
cushion reminded her of hidden treasures,
and diving into her petticoat pocket she
brought forth Aunty Peebles’s gift, and
then the knife; these Polly placed on a
table, which stood near one of the two
windows. Then, after looking about the
room for a moment with an air of much
satisfaction, Polly slipped off her little
shoes, and folding her shawl about her
shoulders after the manner of Mrs. Ramsdell
when ready for a nap, she turned back
the white quilt, and climbing sedately up
on the bed, laid her head on the pillow
and clasped her little hands.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel sleepy,” said Polly, “but that
doesn’t make any difference. I’ve got
plenty of things to think of. Perhaps
Eleanor didn’t always go to sleep. There
are all those leaks in Manser farm&mdash;they’ll
get mended if I’m adopted. And this is a
beautiful place, and I’m not going to be
lonesome, a great girl like me, if ’tis pretty
still here. I wonder what Miss Arctura
Green is doing: and those kitties, I wonder
where they are.”</p>

<p>An hour or so later Miss Hetty
held a consultation with Arctura in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“I came down the back way so I should
not wake that child,” said Miss Pomeroy.
“She hasn’t stirred since she lay down, I
verily believe. Do you think it’s natural
for a little girl of her age to sleep nearly
two hours at this time of
day?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see we
don’t either of us know
much about children,”
said Arctura, meditatively.
“She looks
pretty strong, but I notice
her appetite’s nothing
extra, and probably
she’s all excited up
and tired out. Seems to
me, though, if she don’t
stir by the end of another
half hour I should
kind of make a noise in
my room if I was in
your place, and wake her
up gradual.”</p>

<p>At the end of another
half-hour Miss Pomeroy
opened and shut a window
in her room with
vigor, and when she
stepped across the hall
to Polly’s room, the little
girl was putting on her
shoes.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said
Miss Pomeroy, “you’ve
had a nice, long nap.
You shall take one every
day, my dear, if you
like; I’ve no doubt it will
do you good.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Polly
meekly, with a faint little
smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I shall let you sleep
quite so long, always,” said Miss Hetty,
briskly, “for fear you won’t rest so well at
night: but we’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Polly again; and Miss
Pomeroy never suspected that those two
hours on the bed had seemed like weeks to
her little guest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE FIRST MORNING</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY slept soundly that night in her
little white bed, and woke to see the
sun peeping in at her between the snowy
curtains of her east window.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Polly. “I ought to be
downstairs helping Mrs. Manser this very
minute!” Then she clapped her little
hands over her mouth and lay very still,
remembering where she was, and that Mrs.
Manser and all her old friends were nearly
seven miles away, on Maple Hill.</p>

<p>“I believe I’d better not think about them
just now,” said Polly, winking fast, as she
got out of bed. “Someway it makes me
feel as if I wanted to swallow every minute.
Maybe I can do something for Miss Arctura
Green if I hurry and get dressed.”</p>

<p>But when she stole softly downstairs,
wearing the old red frock covered with one
of her new white aprons, Polly stopped for
a minute to look up at the tall clock. Near
the clock was a high-backed chair, and as
Polly heard Arctura’s voice and a strange
one, she sat down in the chair to wait until
Miss Green’s visitor departed. She was
sitting there when Miss Pomeroy’s door
opened, and down she came over the
stairs.</p>

<p>“So you’re up before me, Mary,” said the
mistress of the house as she held out her
hand to the little girl. Polly took the kind
hand and shook it vigorously up and down
as she had seen grown people do. “For
she doesn’t want to kiss me, of course,”
thought Polly, wistfully, remembering Mrs.
Ramsdell and dear Grandma Manser. “I
expect grand people like her don’t kiss little
girls much.”</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Polly, when the ceremony
was over, “that maybe I could help
Miss Arctura set the table for breakfast,
but I heard her talking to somebody at the
porch door, so I sat down here to wait.”</p>

<p>Just then the door into the hall from the
library burst open and Arctura appeared
with a much vexed expression on her
flushed face.</p>

<p>“Morning, both,” she said, abruptly.
“There, I knew you’d be down and waiting!
’Twas old Jane Hackett kep’ me;
she’s come spying out the land already. I
didn’t let her into the hall for fear she’d
abide with us all day.”</p>

<p>“S&mdash;h, Arctura!” said Miss Pomeroy,
gravely, though her lips seemed inclined
to twitch a little. “How is Mrs. Hackett’s
rheumatism to-day?”</p>

<p>“Thinks there’s a spell coming on, I believe,”
said Arctura, looking rather crestfallen.
“Breakfast’s ready, all but the
griddle-cakes; I can’t sit down with you,
for I’ve got them to fry.”</p>

<p>After breakfast, Miss Pomeroy sent Polly
out on the broad piazza that ran across the
front of the house and the west side, to
play with the kittens.</p>

<p>“I have some plans to talk over with
Arctura,” said she, “and then I want a little
talk with you before I start my letter-writing.
Don’t step off the piazza, for the
grass is very wet. It rained in the night,
and I don’t wish my guest to take cold,”
said Miss Pomeroy, with her pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“I presume,” said Polly to Snip and
Snap, as she dangled a string alluringly just
above their reach, and watched their wild
jumps into the air, “Miss Pomeroy is going
to speak to me about my top apron button
not being buttoned; but I didn’t forget it
till she came down. I was going to ask
Miss Arctura Green to fasten it for me.
Probably Eleanor had long arms that could
reach; I expect she did. Don’t you catch
the bottom of this dress, mister,” said Polly,
uplifting a warning finger at Snap, whose
attitude certainly justified firm, quick
measures, “for it’s just as tender!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Pomeroy and Arctura
were having another consultation in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what to plan about
little Mary,” said Miss Hetty, doubtfully.
“You see, I want to find out what she likes
best to do, so that I can tell what kind of a
child she is. I want her to act her own
nature, but, of course, I must suggest
things and ask some questions, for she’s
very shy.”</p>

<p>“M&mdash;m,” said Arctura, thoughtfully,
“she handles her knife and fork real pretty.
I noticed it as I was in and out the two
meals, yesterday and to-day. You’d know
she come of good folks, and I must say
that Manser woman’s brought her up well,
though she’s a hatchet-faced piece, if ever
I saw one, and given to nagging, if I’m any
judge. Supposing you should ride off to
the village without Mary this morning and
let me visit with her a little mite. She’s
full as used to kitchens as she is to parlors,
I expect.”</p>

<p>“I believe that would be an excellent
idea,” said Miss Pomeroy. “Arctura, you
are a very sensible woman.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” said Arctura but she turned
quickly to the sink to hide a smile of
gratification.</p>

<p>“Now, Mary, you and I will have our
little talk,” said Miss Pomeroy, a few
minutes later, and then to Polly’s great
amazement, she sat down in one of the big
piazza chairs, and drew the child into her
lap.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to forget that top-button,”
said Polly, bravely, “but you came downstairs
sooner than I expected, and I can’t
quite reach it, so I was going to ask Miss
Arctura to fasten it for me. I’m sorry I
was an untidy girl; ’tisn’t Mrs. Manser’s
fault; she spoke to me and spoke to me
about my careless habits.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt she did,” said Miss Hetty,
dryly; “I presume she’d speak to me about
my placket-hook that’s generally undone.”
As she said this she buttoned Polly’s apron
and gave her a pat which warmed the little
girl’s heart; and then Miss Hetty held her
in such a way that Polly could not see the
kind, grave face.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear,” she said, slowly, “I suppose
Mrs. Manser may have told you that
I had a little niece of whom you remind
me.” Polly nodded her head, and scarcely
breathed. “I asked Mrs. Manser to let me
have you for at least a month,” said Miss
Pomeroy, unsteadily, “to see&mdash;to see if perhaps
we might decide to be together as
long as I live, my dear. If you are as like
my little Eleanor as I think you may be,
in many ways,” said Miss Hetty, after a
pause during which Polly sat very still, “I
shall not be able to let you go, I am sure.
I’m growing old, Mary, and I need somebody
to help me forget it. Eleanor
would have done it, I know, though I had
not seen her often enough for her to care a
great deal about me, I’m&mdash;”</p>

<p>Polly turned quickly around as the voice
faltered and stopped. She laid her soft
cheek against Miss Pomeroy’s with a little
cry of sympathy.</p>

<p>“I will be just as like Eleanor as ever I
can,” said Polly, earnestly, “and I will love
you every minute, and try to do everything
you want.”</p>

<p>“I want you to have a good time,” said
Miss Pomeroy, patting the brown curls.
“We are old-fashioned people here, and you
may find it very dull and quiet, my
dear.”</p>

<p>“I shall like it very, very much,” said
Polly, stoutly, and to herself she said,
“There! you can help Miss Pomeroy as
well as the poor-farm folks, Polly Prentiss,
and if you didn’t do it, you’d be as selfish
as old Redtop!” Redtop was a rooster,
resident at Manser farm, whose greed and
ugliness were by-words in the place of his
abode.</p>

<p>“Now I must go to my letter-writing,”
said Miss Pomeroy, briskly, after a few
moments’ silence. She had stroked Polly’s
curls, with a far-away expression, and then
had given her a sudden kiss and set her
down on the piazza floor. “I’m obliged to
do a good many errands to-day, and I think
perhaps I’d better not take you, though I
should, generally. Suppose you run out
to the kitchen and see if you can help Arctura
in any way.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
A LITTLE COOK</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ALF an hour later, anyone who looked
in at the windows of the Pomeroy
kitchen would have seen a pretty
sight. Polly, mounted on a stool, was
beating a golden mixture in a white bowl,
and Arctura, at the opposite end of the
long table, was stirring whites of eggs
carefully into a white batter in a yellow
bowl.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp56" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_polly-was-beating.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">POLLY WAS BEATING A GOLDEN MIXTURE IN A BIG WHITE BOWL</div>
</div>

<p>“This is what I call solid comfort,” said
Arctura, gayly. “I don’t know when I’ve
had such a helper as you are! Miss Hetty’s
without the gift when it comes to cooking.
You wouldn’t believe it, but she’d be just
as likely to put the eggs right in after the
butter, without beating ’em separate, as any
other way. Ain’t it singular?”</p>

<p>“I expect she writes beautiful letters,
Miss Arctura,” said Polly, loyally evading
the discussion of Miss Pomeroy’s weak
point.</p>

<p>“My, I guess she does!” said Arctura,
heartily. “That’s it; we’ve all got different
talents. Hiram says he’d full as soon see
me with a pistol pointed at him as with a
pen in my hand. The only way I ever
wrote a letter was by main strength, and
I’d rather take a whipping any time.”</p>

<p>“I guess it would be pretty hard work for
anybody to whip you,” said Polly, shrewdly,
and Arctura laughed with much relish.</p>

<p>“’Twould now-a-days,” she said, as she
gave the final stir to her batter, “but I’ve
been whipped in my time. I didn’t get my
growth all at once, you see. Is your cake
ready for the pans? You wait till I show
you the cunning little brush I’m going to
butter the tins with. I’ll let you do yours
next time, after I’ve once showed you how.
You can’t slight the edges or any spot, if
you want the cakes to slip out right.”</p>

<p>When the heat of the oven had been
tested and the little round tins had been
put in and the oven doors shut on them,
Arctura selected a stout testing straw from
a pile on a high shelf above the kitchen
sink and seated herself, holding the straw
erect in her hand like a tiny weapon.</p>

<p>“I always take this time for a breathing
spell,” she announced, motioning Polly to
another chair, “for if I start in on a fresh
job, those cakes more’n likely’ll get burned;
it only takes twenty-five minutes to bake
’em to the queen’s taste.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Polly; then she looked
eagerly over at Arctura. “Did you ever see
little Eleanor?” she asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“No, never,” said Arctura, and Polly felt
a throb of disappointment. “You see,
Square Pomeroy didn’t depart this life till
a year ago last December, and he was kind
of queer,” Arctura tapped her forehead
significantly, “the last few years, and
’twasn’t a cheerful place to bring a child.
And he’d hardly let his daughter out of his
sight. About once in six months I’d send
her off to Shelby to see the twins for two or
three days, but I was always put to it to
keep the Square satisfied till she got back.”</p>

<p>“Was he cross?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“Not to say cross,” replied Arctura,
slowly, “but terrible decided and unreasonable.
Miss Hetty’s had her trials, and
so’ve I; money isn’t all.”</p>

<p>“No’m,” said Polly, soberly, “but it does
a great many things, Miss Arctura. Did
you know how poor this town is? Manser
farm leaks in places, and the paint is all
gone, and the ceilings drop sometimes,
pieces of them, I mean. But the town is
too poor to help fix any of those things.
Uncle Sam Blodgett and Father Manser
would shingle the roof quick enough, though
they aren’t as spry as once they were, if only
they could set eyes on the shingles,” said
Polly, quoting freely from her old friends.</p>

<p>“It’s a stingy town, I’m afraid,” said Arctura,
shaking her head. “The Square was
the most liberal man in it, and Miss Hetty
follows right on, but most of the purse
strings are drawn pretty close. Sometime
I’ll tell you a little story about the Square
and me when I was your age; you remind
me to relate it to you. We haven’t got
time now,” she said, glancing at the clock,
“for those cakes have got to come out in a
minute, and then I’ll have to fly around;
dinner time always gains on me, someway.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything special I could
do to please Miss Pomeroy?” asked Polly,
wistfully. “She’s being so good to me.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said Arctura, meditatively.
“Why, of course, she wants you to enjoy
yourself. I expect she’d be pleased to see
you take notice of things like the old shells
and so on, and there’s the books; Bobby
admired to read, and she always said
Eleanor was quite a hand for stories, too.
And you could go to walk with her, pleasant
days, same as Bobby did last winter.
And she’d be glad to see you relish your
food.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do, Miss Arctura,” cried Polly.
“I do, every single bite I take!”</p>

<p>“Well now, that’s good news,” said Miss
Green, comfortably. “I can’t think of anything
else; you do all right so far as I
know. I wouldn’t worry, but just do my
best every day as things come along. Now
we’ll take a look at those cakes.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say a word about playing or
running round,” thought Polly, as Arctura
rose to open the oven doors; “of course,
she thinks I’m too big now for those things,
just as Mrs. Manser said. There’s a girl in
the village that’s most twelve, and she plays
with a dolly, for I’ve seen her. But she
belonged to somebody, and that’s different,
I guess, from when you’re going to be
adopted.”</p>

<p>Polly’s lips seemed inclined to quiver for
a moment, but then her cakes&mdash;the dozen
golden brown cakes&mdash;were lifted from the
oven and set on the table, and in the rush
of delight, at seeing the delicate tops puffed
up above the edges of the tins, the quiver
changed to a smile.</p>

<p>“Arctura says you are a born cook,” said
Miss Pomeroy at dinner time, “and she has
requested the pleasure of your company tomorrow
morning when she makes the
pies.”</p>

<p>Polly dimpled with pleasure; she was
eating steadily, just as much as she could.
Miss Pomeroy noticed her increased appetite
with agreeable surprise.</p>

<p>“Miss Arctura was very, very kind to
me,” said the little girl, sedately, “and I
had a beautiful time, and Miss Arctura said
if the minister&mdash;the supply minister, that’s
nothing more or less than a bashful boy,
according to her ideas&mdash;came to dinner
Sunday, she should set four of my cakes
along with four of hers on the table for
dessert with the pudding.”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy suppressed an inclination
to laugh, and told Polly she had understood
from Arctura that the cakes were a great
success.</p>

<p>“But the minister is not a boy, my dear,”
she added; “you must not always take what
Arctura says word for word. She used to
call me her little girl until I was more than
thirty years old.”</p>

<p>Then Miss Pomeroy and Polly had a
laugh together, though Polly could not help
feeling that Arctura was very brave indeed
ever to have called the tall mistress of
Pomeroy Oaks her little girl.</p>

<p>After dinner came the two naps, or at
least Miss Pomeroy’s nap and Polly’s hour
on the bed. Yesterday’s experience had
taught Polly that an hour’s nap would be
considered enough for her, so at the end
of that time she got off the bed softly, and
after making herself tidy for the rest of the
day, she stole softly downstairs. It was a
mild afternoon, and the big front door had
been half opened so that the spring air
might blow through the screen.</p>

<p>“Of course, if she asks me if I’ve been
asleep, I shall have to say no,” said Polly,
looking a little bit troubled as she stood at
the door, “but I don’t believe she will ask
me. Of course, big girls that want to be
adopted can learn to go to sleep in the day-time,
just as grand grown-up folks do, and
I shall learn as soon as ever I can.”</p>

<p>Polly stepped out on the piazza and
walked softly up and down, sniffing the air,
and thinking how little fear she would have
had of the damp ground if she could have
run out barefoot as she did so often at
Manser farm: and she gave a little sigh as
she looked down at the shiny shoes Miss
Pomeroy had brought home for her that
morning. But Snip and Snap came racing
up on the piazza from somewhere, ready for
a frolic, and Polly did not disappoint them.</p>

<p>Arctura appeared on the kitchen porch,
collecting the milk pans that had been
sunning all day, and snapped her fingers to
attract Polly’s attention.</p>

<p>“Look here,” she called, “my brother,
Hiram, is feeling real neglected because
you haven’t been nigh the barn since you
came. Can’t you step out and visit with
him for a spell now? I’ll call you whenever
Miss Hetty wants you.”</p>

<p>Polly needed no second invitation. She
was ready to go wherever anyone wished,
but, above all things, she had longed to see
the barn, with Daisy in it; and Hiram reminded
her in some way of Uncle Sam
Blodgett, though she could not have told
just how. Certainly the two men did not
look alike, for Uncle Blodgett was lean
and wiry, with a long, thin, nervous face,
while Hiram was stout and ruddy, and
never in a hurry about anything.</p>

<h3>BOBOLINK AND THE STRANGER</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>AS it ever seemed strange to you why
Bobolink should have two suits of
feathers so entirely different? Why,
when he comes to us in the spring, should
he wear a beautiful black and white
costume, and in the fall put on his modest
plumage of brown? It was not always so.
The time was when Bobolink wore his
best spring plumage all year round; but
that, of course, was before his quarrel with
Rough-leg. Rough-leg was one of the
hawk family and was really the most agreeable
of them. He had never been known
to disturb the birds, but made his entire living
by catching mice. No wonder, then,
that he was greatly provoked when, after
he had watched patiently for two hours
in the hot sun with the vain hope of catching
Meadow-mouse, he learned that the latter
had been warned by Bobolink. Although
generally good-natured, Rough-leg had a
temper and he was very angry at Bobolink
for poking his bill into other folks’
affairs. He was even heard to threaten
to dine upon Bobolink instead of Meadow-mouse.</p>

<p>This, of course, was alarming news to
Bobolink, yet he never regretted saving
Meadow-mouse, who had been one of his
old neighbors for years. Nevertheless, he
was greatly worried at the threat and went
South to his winter home earlier than usual
that year, for fear that Rough-leg would
catch him.</p>

<p>The next spring when he reached the
Great Meadows again Bobolink supposed
that the whole matter had been forgotten.
But no. There, on exactly the same limb
of the tall poplar, as if he had been waiting
all winter, sat Rough-leg. Bobolink
was so frightened that he did not stop at
the Meadows, as had been his custom, but
went straight North many miles even past
his summer home. Rough-leg had kept his
eyes shut and pretended not to see Bobolink
when he arrived on the Meadows,
but in reality he was only waiting for a good
chance to get his claws upon him. So, of
course, his disappointment was great when
he opened his eyes, to find that Bobolink
had gone. Somehow this only made him
more determined, and he resolved to catch
Bobolink if it took a year. To a bird a year
is a very long time. Rough-leg knew that
Bobolink would have to stop at the Great
Meadow on his way south in the autumn,
for there he must get his food supply.
Rough-leg would wait for him. His
feathers puffed out and his eyes blazed
as he thought of revenge.</p>

<p>At length the hot summer drew to a close,
and Bobolink bethought himself of going
South, for, of course, he could not remain
where he was all winter. But he shuddered
as he thought of Rough-leg. He
must stop at the Great Meadows else he
could get no food until he reached the rice
lands.</p>

<p>It would soon begin to get cold, and already
the birds around him were leaving.
They seemed to enjoy the fact that he
could not follow. That mischievous little
imp, Maryland Yellow-throat, especially
took the greatest delight in peeping out
from his brier thicket and then calling in
his shrill voice, “Wintery, Wintery, Wintery,”
just for the fun of seeing Bobolink
look round anxiously at the falling leaves.</p>

<p>And now Blackbird, usually among the
last, was ready to go and would soon be
feeding lavishly on the reed seeds. They
would not last long. Bobolink was at his
wit’s end. Then, as from the top of a
reed he looked wistfully at the dusky form
of departing Song Sparrow, an idea occurred
to him.</p>

<p>That afternoon he disappeared. He was
not seen on the next day nor the next. At
the end of the third day a very strange-looking
bird might have been seen hopping
about in the thicket which Bobolink had
occupied. This newcomer was a modest
fellow. He wore a plain, brown coat without
a trace of the tall, white collar such as
adorned Bobolink; and he talked very little.
Indeed, his only note seemed to be a dull,
little chirp which no one understood. While
folks in the north country were beginning
to wonder who this new comer could be, he,
too, disappeared. A little later the birds of
the Great Meadow were surprised to see
what to them was a very odd-looking
traveler. He was no other than the brown
stranger who had just left the north
country. No one remembered to have
seen him before.</p>

<p>Rough-leg, who from his high lookout
kept his eyes open for Bobolink, saw the
newcomer, but the modest plumage awakened
little interest in his mind. Blackbird,
who always fed near the stranger, kept up
a sociable chat all the time, but he was unable
to learn anything of the other’s history.
Indeed the latter, although polite, paid little
attention to his neighbors but went on busily
about his food. He soon became quite
stout.</p>

<p>The fall had nearly passed. All the
birds except Rough-leg, Blackbird, and the
stranger had gone South. The leaves had
fallen and the reeds turned to brown fagots.
Rough-leg still kept up his weary
look-out. Occasionally he would launch
himself from the now leafless poplar and
circle over the Meadows. The brown bird
would bolt up nervously from his feeding
ground and Blackbird, thinking that it was
he who had disturbed him would flutter
overhead, calling out heartily, “Don’t mind
me-e-e! Don’t mind me-e-e!” But in
spite of Blackbird’s cheer the stranger
would start up every time Rough-leg’s
shadow passed over the meadow. But one
day when the autumn wind murmured
through the dry reeds the brown bird
had flown. A day later Blackbird followed.</p>

<p>Old Rough-leg still keeps up his watch.
Every little while you can see him launch
out from the great poplar and circle above
the Meadows as if perchance Bobolink might
be hiding among the reeds. But his
search is vain. Often, however, he sees the
brown stranger, whom folks have since
named Reed Bird, but as he sails back to his
favorite perch, he vainly wonders what has
become of Bobolink in his beautiful coat of
black and white.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would wonder still more if he
knew that, although they pass to and fro
with each year’s migration, Bobolink and
Reed Bird have never met. Couldn’t the
reader explain something of this to old
Rough-leg?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
A Woodland Menagerie</h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Brought up in the forests of northern Maine, and
seeing few persons excepting her uncle and Angelique,
the Indian housekeeper, Margot Romeyn knows
little of life beyond the deep hemlocks. Naturally
observant, she is encouraged in her out-of-door
studies by her uncle, at one time a college professor.
Through her woodland instincts, she and her uncle
are enabled to save the life of Adrian Wadislaw,
a youth who, lost and almost overcome with hunger,
has been wandering in the neighboring forest. To
Margot the new friend is a welcome addition to her
small circle of acquaintances, and after his rapid
recovery she takes great delight in showing him the
many wonders of the forest about her home.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">“H</span>OO-AH! Yo-ho! H-e-r-e! This
way!”</p>

<p>Adrian followed the voice. It led
him aside into the woods on the eastern
slope, and it was accompanied by an indescribable
babel of noises. Running
water, screaming of wild fowl, cooing of
pigeons, barking of dogs or some other
beasts, cackling, chattering, laughter.</p>

<p>All the sounds of wild life ceased suddenly
in the tree-tops as Adrian approached,
recognizing and fearing his alien
presence. But they were reassured by
Margot’s familiar summons, and soon the
menagerie he had suspected was gathered
about her.</p>

<p>“Whew! it just rains squirrels&mdash;and
chipmunks&mdash;and birds! Hello! that’s a
fawn; that’s a fox! as sure as I’m alive, a
magnificent red fox! Why isn’t he eating
the whole outfit? And&mdash;hurrah!”</p>

<p>To the amazement of the watcher, there
came from the depths of the woods a sound
that always thrills the pulses of any hunter&mdash;the
cry of a moose-calf, accompanied by
a soft crashing of branches, growing gradually
louder.</p>

<p>“So they tame even the moose&mdash;these
wonderful people! What next!” and as
Adrian leaned forward the better to watch
the advance of this uncommon pet, the
next concerning which he had speculated
also approached. Slowly up the river bank
stalked a pair of blue herons, and for them
Margot had her warmest welcome.</p>

<p>“Heigho, Xanthippé, Socrates! What
laggards! But here’s your breakfast, or
one of them. I suppose you’ve eaten the
other long ago. Indeed, you’re always
eating, gourmands!”</p>

<p>The red fox eyed the new-comers with a
longing eye and crept cautiously to his
mistress’ side as she coaxed the herons
nearer. But she was always prepared for
any outbreak of nature among her forest
friends, and drew him also close to her with
the caressing touch she might have bestowed
upon a beloved house-dog.</p>

<p>“Reynard, you beauty! your head in my
lap, sir;” and dropping to a sitting posture,
she forced him to obey her. There he lay,
winking but alert, which she scattered her
store of good things right and left. There
were nuts for the squirrels and ’munks,
grains and seeds for the winged creatures,
and for the herons, as well as Reynard, a
few bits of dried meat. But for Browser,
the moose-calf, she pulled the tender twigs
and foliage with a lavish hand. When she
had given some dainty to each of her oddly-assorted
pets, she sprang up, closed the box,
and waved her arms in dismissal. The
more timid of the creatures obeyed her, but
some held their ground persistently, hoping
for greater favors. To these she paid no
further attention, and still keeping hold of
Reynard’s neck, started back to her human
guest.</p>

<p>The fox, however, declined to accompany
her. He distrusted strangers, and, it may
be, had designs of his own upon some other
forest wilding.</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it. We tame them
and they love us. But they are only conquered,
not changed. Isn’t Reynard beautiful?
Doesn’t he look noble? as noble as
a St. Bernard dog? If you’ll believe me,
that fellow is thoroughly acquainted with
every one of Angelique’s fowls, and knows
he must never, never touch them. Yet
he’d eat one, quick as a flash, if he got a
chance. He’s a coward, though; and by
his cowardice we manage him. Sometimes,”
sighed Margot, who had led the
way into a little path toward the lake.</p>

<p>“How odd! You seem actually grieved
at this state of things.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I be? I love him, and I
have a notion that love will do anything
with anybody or anything. I do believe it
will, but that I haven’t found just the right
way of showing it. Uncle laughs at me, a
little, but helps me all he can. Indeed, it
is he who has tamed most of our pets. He
says it is the very best way to study natural
history.”</p>

<p>“H-m-m! He intends your education
shall be complete!”</p>

<p>“Of course. But one thing troubles him.
He cannot teach me music. And you seem
surprised. Aren’t girls, where you come
from, educated? Doesn’t everybody prize
knowledge?”</p>

<p>“That depends. Our girls are educated,
of course. They go to college and all that,
but I think you’d down any of them in
exams. For my own part, I ran away just
because I did not want this famous ‘education’
you value. That is, I didn’t of a certain
sort. I wasn’t fair with you awhile
ago, you said. I’d like to tell you my story
now.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear it, of course. But, look
yonder! Did you ever see anything like
that?”</p>

<p>Margot was proud of the surprises she
was able to offer this stranger in her woods,
and pointed outward over the lake. They
had just come to an open place on the
shore and the water spread before them,
sparkling in the sunlight. Something was
crossing the smooth surface, heading
straight for their island, and of a nature
to make Adrian cry out:</p>

<p>“Oh! for a gun!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>VIII<br />
KING MADOC</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">“I</span>F you had one you should not use it!
Are you a dreadful hunter?”</p>

<p>Margot had turned upon her guest
with a defiant fear. As near as she had
ever come to hating anything she hated the
men, of whom she had heard, who used this
wonderful northland as a murder ground.
That was what she named it in her uncompromising
judgment of those who
killed for the sake of killing, for the lust of
blood that was in them.</p>

<p>“Yes; I reckon I am a ‘dreadful’ hunter,
for I am a mighty poor shot. But I’d like
a try at that fellow. What horns! what a
head! and how can that fellow in the canoe
keep so close to him, yet not finish him?”</p>

<p>Adrian was so excited he could not stand
still. His eyes gleamed, his hands clenched,
and his whole appearance was changed;
greatly for the worse, the girl thought, regarding
him with disgust.</p>

<p>“Finish him? That’s King Madoc,
Pierre’s trained moose. You’d be finished
yourself, I fear, if you harmed that
splendid creature. Pierre’s a lazy fellow,
mostly, but he spent a long time teaching
Madoc; and with his temper&mdash;I’m thankful
you lost your gun.”</p>

<p>“Do you never shoot things up here? I
saw you giving the fox and herons what
looked like meat. You had a stew for
supper, and fish for breakfast. I don’t
mean to be impertinent, but the sight of
that big game&mdash;whew!”</p>

<p>“Yes; we do kill things, or have them
killed, when it is necessary for food. Never
in sport. Man is almost the only animal
who does that. It’s all terrible, seems to
me. Everything preys upon something
else, weaker than itself. Sometimes when
I think of it, my dinner chokes me. It’s so
easy to take life, and only God can create
it. But uncle says it is also God’s law
to take what is provided, and that there is
no mistake, even if it seems such to me.”</p>

<p>But there Margot perceived that Adrian
was not listening. Instead, he was watching,
with the intensest interest, the closer
approach of the canoe, in which sat idle
Pierre, holding the reins of a harness attached
to his aquatic steed. The moose
swam easily, with powerful strokes, and
Pierre was singing a gay melody, richer in
his unique possession than any king.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it’s not one other has a king for
a bow man,” he often asserted.</p>

<p>When he touched the shore and the great
animal stood shaking his wet hide, Adrian’s
astonishment found vent in a whirlwind of
questions that Pierre answered at his
leisure and after his kind. But he walked
first toward Margot and offered her a great
bunch of trailing arbutus flowers, saying:</p>

<p>“I saw these just as I pushed off and
went back after them. What’s the matter
here, that the flag is up? It was the
biggest storm I ever saw. Yes; a deal of
beasties are killed back on the mainland.
Any dead over here?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m glad to say, none that we know
of. But Snowfoot’s shed is down and uncle
is going to build a new one. I hope you’ve
come to work.”</p>

<p>Pierre laughed and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes.”</p>

<p>But his interest in work was far less than
in the stranger whom he now answered,
and whose presence on Peace Island was
a mystery to him. Heretofore, the only
visitors there had been laborers or traders,
but this young fellow, so near his own age,
and despite his worn clothing, was of
another sort. He recognized this, at once,
as Margot had done, and his curiosity made
him ask:</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from? Hurricane
blow you out the sky?”</p>

<p>“About the same. I was lost in the
woods and Margot found me and saved
my life. What’ll you take for that
moose?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t money enough in the State
of Maine to buy him!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Well, if there was I haven’t
it. But you could get a good price for it
anywhere.”</p>

<p>Pierre looked Adrian over. From his
appearance the lad was not likely to be
possessed of much cash, but the moose-trainer
was eager for capital, and never
missed an opportunity of seeking it.</p>

<p>“I want to go into the show business.
What do you say? would you furnish the
tents and fixings, and share the profits?
I’m no scholar, but maybe you’d know
enough to get out the hand bills and so on.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;say&mdash;What you mean, Pierre Ricord,
keepin’ the master waitin’ your
foolishness and him half sick? What kept
you twice as long as you ought? Hurry
up, now, and put that moose in the cow
yard and get to work.”</p>

<p>The interruption was caused by Angelique,
and it was curious to see the fear with
which she inspired the great fellow, her son.
He forgot the stranger, the show business,
and all his own immediate interests, and
with the docility of a little child obeyed.
Unhitching his odd steed, he turned the
canoe bottom upwards on the beach and
hastily led the animal toward that part of
the island clearing where Snowfoot stood
in a little fenced-in lot behind her ruined
shed.</p>

<p>Adrian went with him, and asked:</p>

<p>“Won’t those two animals fight?”</p>

<p>“Won’t get a chance. When one goes
in the other goes out. Here, bossy, you
can take the range of the island. Get
out!”</p>

<p>She was more willing to go than Madoc
to enter the cramped place, but the transfer
was made, and Adrian lingered by the
osier paling, to observe at close range this
subjugated monarch of the forest.</p>

<p>“Oh! for a palette and brush!” he exclaimed,
while Pierre walked away.</p>

<p>“What would you do with them?”</p>

<p>Margot had followed the lads and was
beside Adrian, though he had not heard her
footsteps. Now he wheeled about, eager,
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“Paint&mdash;as I have never painted before!”</p>

<p>“Oh!&mdash;are you an&mdash;artist?”</p>

<p>“I want to be one. That’s why I’m
here.”</p>

<p>“What! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I told you I was a runaway. I didn’t
say why, before. It’s truth. My people,
my&mdash;father&mdash;forced me to college. I hated
it. He was forcing me to business. I liked
art. All my friends were artists. When I
should have been at the books I was in
their studios. They were a gay crowd,
spent money like water when they had it;
merrily starved and pinched when they
hadn’t. A few were worse than spendthrifts,
and with my usual want of sense I
made that particular set my intimates.
I never had any money, though, after it
was suspected what my tastes were, except
a little that my mother gave.”</p>

<p>Margot was listening breathlessly and
watching intently. At the mention of his
mother a shadow crossed Adrian’s face,
softening and bettering it, and as they rose
to go home she saw that his whole mood had
changed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>IX.<br />
AN UNANSWERABLE QUESTION</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was weeks afterward when they were
again surrounded by the many wonderful
inhabitants of the forest that Adrian
mentioned his own parents. Their talk
drifted from vexing subjects to merry
anecdotes of his childhood, in the home
where he had been the petted, only brother
of a half-dozen elder sisters. But while
they laughed and Margot listened, her
fingers were busy weaving a great garland
of wild laurel, and when it was finished she
rose and said:</p>

<p>“It’s getting late. There’ll be just time
to take this to the grave. Will you go
with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>But this was another of the puzzling
things he found at Peace Island. In its
very loveliest nook was the last resting-place
of Cecily Romeyn, and the sacred spot
was always beautiful with flowers, or, in the
winter, with brilliant berries. Both the
master and the girl spoke of their dead as
if she were still present with them; or, at
least, lived as if she were only removed
from sight but not from their lives.</p>

<p>When Margot had laid the fresh wreath
upon the mound, she carefully removed
the faded flowers of the day before, and a
thought of his own mother stirred Adrian’s
heart.</p>

<p>“I wish I could send a bunch of such
blossoms to the mater!”</p>

<p>“How can you live without her, since
she is still alive?”</p>

<p>His face hardened again.</p>

<p>“You forget. I told you that she, too,
turned against me at the last. It was a
case of husband or son, and she made her
choice.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no. She was unhappy. One may
do strange things then, I suppose. But I
tell you one thing: if I had either father
or mother, anywhere in this world; no matter
if either was bad&mdash;had done everything
that is sinful!&mdash;nothing should ever, ever
make me leave them. Nothing. I would
bear anything, do anything, suffer anything&mdash;but
I would be true to them. I
could not forget that I was their child, and
if I had done wrong to them my whole life
would be too short to make atonement.”</p>

<p>She spoke strongly, as she felt. So early
orphaned, she had come to think of her
parents as the most wonderful blessing in
the power of God to leave one. She loved
her Uncle Hugh like a second father, but
her tenderest dreams were over the pictured
faces of her dead.</p>

<p>“Where is your father buried?”</p>

<p>It was the simplest, most natural question.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t&mdash;know.”</p>

<p>They stared at one another. It was
proof of her childlike acceptance of her life
that she had never asked&mdash;had never
thought to do so, even. She had been told
that he had passed out of sight before
they came to Peace Island and the forest,
and had asked no further concerning him.
Of his character and habits she had heard
much. Her uncle was never weary in extolling
his virtues; but of his death he had
said only what has been written.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I must know right away!”</p>

<p>In her eagerness she ran, and Adrian
followed as swiftly. He was
sorry for his thoughtless inquiry,
but regret came too
late. He tried to call Margot
back, but she would not wait.</p>

<p>“I must know&mdash;I must
know right away. Why have
I never thought before?”</p>

<p>Hugh Dutton was resting
after a day of
study and
mental labor,
and his head
leaned easily
upon his
cushioned
chair. Yet
as his dear
child entered
his room he
held out his
arms to draw
her to his
knee.</p>

<p>“In a minute,
uncle.
But Adrian
has asked me
something
and it is the
strangest thing that I cannot answer him.
Where is my father buried?”</p>

<p>If she had dealt him a mortal blow he
could not have turned more white. With a
groan that pierced her very heart, he stared
at Margot with wide, unseeing eyes; then
sprang to his feet and fixed upon poor
Adrian a look that scorched.</p>

<p>“You! you!” he gasped, and, sinking
back, covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>X<br />
PERPLEXITIES</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT had he done?</p>

<p>Ignorant why his simple question
should have such strange results,
that piercing look made Adrian feel the
veriest culprit, and he hastened to leave the
room and the cabin. Hurrying to the
beach, he appropriated Margot’s little canvas
canoe and pushed out upon
the lake. From her and Pierre
he had learned to handle the
light craft with considerable
skill, and he now worked off his
excitement by swift paddling, so
that there was soon a wide distance
between him and the
island.</p>

<p>Then he paused and looked
around him, upon as fair a scene
as could be found in any land.
Unbroken forests bounded this
hidden Lake Profundus, out of
whose placid waters rose that
mountain-crowned, verdure-clad
Island of Peace, with its picturesque
home and its cultured
owner, who
had brought
into this best
of the wilderness
the best
of civilization.</p>

<p>“What is
this mystery?
How am I
concerned in
it? For I
am, and mystery there is. It is like
that mist over the island, which I
can see and feel but cannot touch.
Pshaw! I’m getting sentimental, when I
ought to be turning detective. Yet I
couldn’t do that&mdash;pry into the private
affairs of a man who’s treated me so
generously. What shall I do? How can
I go back there? But where else can I
go?”</p>

<p>At the thought that he might never return
to the roof he had quitted, a curious
homesickness seized him.</p>

<p>“Who’ll hunt what game they need?
Who’ll catch their fish? Who’ll keep the
garden growing? Where can I study the
forest and its furry people, at first hand, as
in the Hollow? And I was doing well&mdash;not
as I hope to do, but getting on.
Margot was a merciless critic, but even she
admitted that my last picture had the look,
the spirit of the woods. That’s what I
want to do, what Mr. Dutton, also, approved:
to bring glimpses of these solitudes
back to the cities and the thousands
who can never see them in any other way.
Well&mdash;let it go. I can’t stay and be a torment
to anybody, and sometime in some
other place, maybe&mdash;Ah!”</p>

<p>What he had mistaken for the laughter of
a loon was Pierre’s halloo. He was coming
back, then, from the mainland where
he had been absent these past days.
Adrian was thankful. There was nothing
mysterious or perplexing about Pierre,
whose rule of life was extremely simple:</p>

<p>“Pierre, first, second, and forever. After
Pierre, if there was anything left, then&mdash;anybody,
the nearest at hand,” would have
expressed the situation; but his honest, unblushing
selfishness was sometimes a relief.</p>

<p>“One always knows just where to find
Pierre,” Margot had said.</p>

<p>So Adrian’s answering halloo was
prompt, and, turning about, he watched the
birch leaving the shadow of the forest and
heading for himself. It was soon alongside
and Ricord’s excited voice was shouting
his good news:</p>

<p>“Run him up to seven hundred and
fifty!”</p>

<p>“But I thought there wasn’t money
enough anywhere to buy him?”</p>

<p>Pierre cocked his dark head on one side
and winked.</p>

<p>“Madoc sick and Madoc well are different.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wretch! Would you sell a
sick moose and cheat the buyer?”</p>

<p>“Would I lose such a pile of money for
foolishness? I guess not.”</p>

<p>“But suppose, after you parted with him,
he got well?”</p>

<p>Again the woodlander grinned and
winked.</p>

<p>“Could you drive the King?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right. I buy him back,
what you call trade. One do that many
times, good enough. If&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pierre was silent for some moments,
during which Adrian had steadily paddled
backward to the island, keeping time with
the other boat, and without thinking what
he was doing. But when he did remember,
he turned to Pierre and asked:</p>

<p>“Will you take me across the lake
again?”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“No matter. I’ll just leave Margot’s
canoe and you do it. There’s time
enough.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you give me?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! What can I give you?
Nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. My mother, she wants
the salt,” and he kicked the sack of that valuable
article lying at his feet. “There, she’s
on the bank now, and it’s not she will let
me out of her sight again, this long time.”</p>

<p>“You’d go fast enough for money.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not. When one has Angelique
Ricord for mére&mdash;U-m-m!”</p>

<p>But it was less for Pierre than for Adrian
that Angelique was waiting, and her expression
was kinder than common.</p>

<p>“Carry that salt to my kitchen cupboard,
son, and get to bed. No; you’ve no call
to tarry. What the master’s word is for his
guest is nothin’ to you.”</p>

<p>Pierre’s curiosity was roused. Why had
Adrian wanted to leave the island at nightfall,
since there was neither hunting nor
fishing to be done? Sport for sport’s sake&mdash;that
was forbidden. And what could be
the message he was not to hear? He
meant to learn, and lingered, busying himself
uselessly in beaching the canoes afresh,
after he had once carefully turned them
bottom side upwards: in brushing out
imaginary dirt, readjusting his own clothing&mdash;a
task he did not often bother with&mdash;and
in general making himself a nuisance
to his impatient parent.</p>

<p>But, so long as he remained, she kept
silence, till, unable to hold back her rising
anger, she stole up behind him, unperceived,
and administered a sounding box
upon his sizable ears.</p>

<p>“Would you? To the cupboard, miserable!”
and Adrian could not repress a smile
at the meekness with which the great woodlander
submitted to the little woman’s
authority.</p>

<p>“Xanthippé and Socrates!” he murmured,
and Pierre heard him. So, grimacing
at him from under the heavy sack,
he called back “Fifty dollar. Tell her fifty&mdash;dollar.”</p>

<p>“What did he mean by fifty dollar?” demanded
Angelique.</p>

<p>“I suppose something about that show
business of his. It is his ambition, you
know, and I must admit I believe he’d be
a success at it.”</p>

<p>“Pouf! There is more better business
than the showin’ one, of takin’ God’s
beasties in the towns and lettin’ the fool
people stare. The money comes that way
is not good money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. It’s all right, fair Angelique.
But what is the word for me?”</p>

<p>“It is: that you come with me, at once,
to the master. He will speak with you before
he sleeps. Yes. And, Adrian, lad!”</p>

<p>“Well, Angelique?”</p>

<p>“This is the truth. Remember&mdash;when
the heart is sore tried the tongue is often
sharp. There is death&mdash;that is a sorrow&mdash;God
sends it. There are sorrows God
does not send, but the evil one. Death
is but joy to them. What the master
says, answer; and luck light upon your
lips.”</p>

<p>The lad had never seen the old housekeeper
so impressive nor so gentle. At
the moment it seemed as if she almost liked
him, though, despite the faithfulness with
which she had obeyed her master’s wishes
and served him, he had never before suspected
it.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Angelique. I am troubled,
too, and I will take care that I neither say
nor resent anything harsh. More than
that, I will go away. I have stayed too
long already, though I had hoped I was
making myself useful. Is he in his own
study?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the little maid is with him.
No&mdash;there she comes, but she is not
laughin’, no. Oh! the broken glass. Scat!
Meroude. Why leap upon one to scare
the breath out, that way? Pst! ’Tis here
that tame creatures grow wild and wild ones
tame. Scat! I say.”</p>

<p>Margot was coming through the rooms,
holding Reynard by the collar she made
him wear whenever he was in the neighborhood
of the hen-house, and Tom limped listlessly
along upon her other side. There was
trouble and perplexity in the girl’s face, and
Angelique made a great pretense of being
angry with the cat, to hide that in her own.</p>

<p>But Margot noticed neither her nor
Adrian, and sitting down upon the
threshold dropped her chin in her hands
and fixed her eyes upon the darkening lake.</p>

<p>“Why, mistress! The beast here at the
cabin, and it nightfall! My poor fowls!”</p>

<p>“He’s leashed, you see, Angelique. And
I’ll lock the poultry up, if you like,” observed
Adrian. Anything to delay a little
an interview from which he shrank with
something very like that cowardice of which
the girl had once accused him.</p>

<p>The housekeeper’s ready temper flamed,
and she laid an ungentle touch upon the
stranger’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Go, boy. When Master Hugh commands,
’tis not for such as we to disobey.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m going; and I’ll remember.”</p>

<p>At the inner doorway he turned and
looked back. Margot was still sitting,
thoughtful and motionless, the firelight
from the great hearth making a Rembrandt-like
silhouette of her slight figure
against the outer darkness and touching
her wonderful hair with a flood of silver.
Reynard and the eagle, the wild foresters
her love had tamed, stood guard on either
side. It was a picture that appealed to
Adrian’s artistic sense and he lingered a
little, regarding its effects, even considering
what pigments would best convey
them.</p>

</div>

<p>“Adrian!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Angelique&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>When the door shut behind him, Angelique
touched her darling’s shining head,
and the toil-stiffened fingers had for it almost
a mother’s tenderness.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart, the bed-time.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I’m going, Angelique; my
uncle sent me from him to-night. It was
the first time in all my life that I remember.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, little stupid, because you’ve
never waited for that, before, but were
quick enough to see whenever you were not
wanted.”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;there’s something wrong, and
Adrian is the cause of it. I&mdash;Angelique,
you tell me&mdash;uncle did not hear, or reply,
any way&mdash;where is my father buried?”</p>

<p>Angelique was prepared and had her
answer ready.</p>

<p>“’Tis not for the servant to reveal what
her master hides. No&mdash;all will come to
you in good time. Tarry the master’s will.
But, that silly Pierre! What think you?
Is it fifty dollar would be the price of they
tame blue herons? Hey?”</p>

<p>“No; nor fifty times fifty. Pierre knows
that. Love is more than money.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, to some folks. Well, what
would you? That son will be havin’ even
me, his old mother, in his show&mdash;why
not? As a cur’osity&mdash;the only livin’
human bein’ can make that ingrate mind.
Yes&mdash;to bed, ma p’tite.”</p>

<p>Margot rose and housed her pets. This
threat of Pierre’s, that he would eventually
carry off the foresters and exhibit their
helplessness to staring crowds, always
roused her fiercest indignation; and this
result was just what Angelique wanted, at
present, and she murmured her satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Good! That bee will buzz in her ear
till she sleeps, and so sound she’ll hear no
dip of the paddle, by and by. Here, Pierre,
my son, you’re wanted.”</p>

<p>“What for, now? Do leave me be. I’m
going to bed. I’m just wore out, trot-trottin’
from Pontius to Pilate, luggin’ salt,
and&mdash;” he finished by yawning most prodigiously.</p>

<p>“Firs’-rate sign, that gapin’. Yes&mdash;sign
you’re healthy and able to do all’s needed.
There’s no rest for you this night. Come&mdash;here&mdash;take
this basket to the beach. If
your canoe needs pitchin’, pitch it. There’s
the lantern. If one goes into the show
business he learns right now to work and
travel o’ nights. Yes&mdash;start&mdash;I’ll follow
and explain.”</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>EITHER age, learning, nor fortune
are needed to enable one to love and
admire these gracious children of
beauty&mdash;the flowers.</p>

<p>When the chill winds of autumn sound
a knell for their departure, we have a sense
of loneliness and loss. As the winter
passes we long for the days when the
blossoms shall come again.</p>

<p>The first tiny blossom of the star-flower;
the first little tasseled bloom on the birch;
the first adder’s tongue, or violet, or broad,
white salver of the mandrake flower; the
snowy banners of the dogwood; the gray-white
of the brave little plantain-leaved
everlasting, fill all hearts with delight.</p>

<p>The life object of the flower is the production
of seed. All the parts of the flower
are in some way fitted to further that end.
What is the story of the flower?</p>

<p>The stem and branches having developed
a certain amount of leafage, may at length
put forth blossoms. These spring, as leaves
do, from the tips or axils of the branches.
In truth, a flower is a modified branch, and
all its parts are modified leaves. We will
pass over this distinction of science, and
will consider the flower as we popularly
think and speak of it, the beautiful producer
of seeds.</p>

<p>What is called a perfect flower we will
examine in the common buttercup of the
fields. At the top of the stem we find a
cup or calyx of five narrow, separate green
leaves, called sepals; these form the outer
wrapping of the bud, and maintain and
protect the more delicate inner parts of a
flower. Within the calyx is the corolla&mdash;five
glossy, yellow, roundish petals, set in
a circle; within this we have another ring
of downy, bright-yellow stamens, and still
within these, protected by all the others,
certain yellow pistils, fewer and firmer in
texture than the stamens.</p>

<p>All of these four rings of parts are placed
upon the fleshy, enlarged top of the stem,
which is called the receptacle. The yellow
of this flower is very yellow, and the stem
and leaves are very green. The stem and
leaves of our buttercups are hairy; the
whole plant is provided with a sharp, stinging
juice.</p>

<p>The buttercup, as we have seen, is made
up of four circles, each composed of several
distinct parts.</p>

<p>A flower with several petals is called
polypetalous.</p>

<p>Other flowers have but one petal; they
are styled monopetalous. In fact, in such
one-petaled flowers a number of petals have
simply grown together. Let us take the
morning-glory as an example. Pull off the
calyx; it comes off as a whole, but is cleft
half way down into five lobes, showing that
it is truly composed of five united petals.
Now pull the corolla from another calyx
cup; it comes as a whole, and is not cleft as
the calyx is, but it has five stripes, and at
each stripe the margin has a little point, and
we can make out very plainly that here
are five prettily-pointed petals united into
one, with a long tube made of the claws,
and a beautiful wide margin made of the
banners. Four-o’clocks, stramonium, Canterbury
bells, phlox, and many other
flowers have these one-petaled corollas.
Such corollas differ greatly in shape, owing
to the length and diameter of the tube and
margin.</p>

<p>In the polypetalous corollas we have the
rich splendors of roses, from single to the
fullest double, where cultivation has
changed all stamens and pistils into petals.
The polypetalous tribe give us also the
lovely, perfume-filled chalices of the lilies;
the peas, with their many-colored banners;
the charming violets, with their spurred
petals; the columbine, with its horns of
plenty.</p>

<p>Color of some kind is one of the distinguishing
features of blossoms.</p>

<p>Fragrance is another marked characteristic
of plants, and is chiefly in the
flower.</p>

<p>There are plenty of scentless
plants, yet the majority are full of
perfume. Some few have a very
disagreeable smell. Fragrance in
plants comes from certain oils or
resin laid up in different parts of
the plant, whether in the leaves,
bark, wood, fruit, seeds, or blossoms.</p>

<p>In the month of May flowers
crowd upon us in numbers so
great that we are at a loss for a
time to study them. Even if April
has been cold, the matchless arbutus
has found time to bloom above
last year’s protecting leaves and
has passed away, leaving only a
memory of its fragrance and rosy
beauty. The dandelions&mdash;jolly,
popular, child-beloved gold of the
spring&mdash;have bloomed, and in May
the grass is covered with their
delicate clocks; we still, in early
May, find the oxalis almost making
a carpet for the pasture lands or
sunny hillsides. When the oxalis
grows in damp shade its flowers
and leaves are larger and
of a deeper color, but the blossoms are
fewer. The leaf of the oxalis is three-divided,
like the coarser leaf of the clover.</p>

<p>Some hold that it was the oxalis and not
the shamrock leaf which good St. Patrick
took to prove the possibility of Trinity&mdash;one
in three. Some think that really the oxalis
and not the clover was the shamrock of
the ancient Irish.</p>

<p>May brings us an abundance of wild
violets; the blue violets and the beautiful
tri-colored pansies come in April, but the
blue violets linger, growing larger and
richer, while their cousins, the dainty white
and the branching yellow violets, appear in
the cool, damp woods. The wild violets are
scentless, except for the spicy “woods odor”
that seems to hang about all wild flowers.</p>

<p>A much humbler flower than the violets
greets us on the roadsides&mdash;the bright
yellow cinquefoil, its vine leaves, and
blossom bearing resemblance to the strawberry,
so that the county people call them
“yellow-flowered strawberries.” Common
as the cinquefoil is, it belongs to a noble,
even royal, family among flowers&mdash;the
rose. It is a poor cousin of the garden’s
queen.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR our name we have chosen <span class="smcap">Youth</span>.
This word is the fullest expression
of our ambition. It stands for that
period of human life toward which the very
young folk look forward with pleasant anticipations,
and the old look back with
something like regret. It contains the suggestion
of hope, vigor, and buoyancy&mdash;the
ideal requisites of America’s young folks.
Surely we might have looked far for a
more fitting title.</p>

<p>Although a new name to many, and
therefore lacking in that esteem which only
long acquaintance can give, we have every
reason to expect the same generous greeting
which we have heretofore received.</p>

<p>Indeed, beginning with this issue, we
shall have with us many who have known
<span class="smcap">Youth</span> in its earlier home. We offer them
a hearty welcome and promise to do our
utmost to deserve a continuation of their
stanch support.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img class="center" src="images/i_hrwte.jpg" alt="decoration" />
  </div>

<p>A great many well-meaning people seem
to regard childhood and youth in the light
of an ailment. This is painfully apparent
in their views of juvenile literature. As
they might forbid a particular diet to all
invalids, so, just as rigidly, they prohibit
the reading of this or that form of literature
by those afflicted with youthfulness.</p>

<p>Like the doctors who deal with our physical
bodies, these very earnest people seldom
agree among themselves as to the proper
remedies and measures of prevention.</p>

<p>What, most unfortunately, they do agree
in, is that the best attention must be given
to the supposed ailment instead of to the
individual boy or girl. No young person
should be allowed to read fairy stories, says
one. Nor stories without an immediate
moral purpose, declares another. Nor
stories of adventure, insists a third.</p>

<p>Now, upon behalf of the young people
themselves, we wish to enter our most
solemn objection to this kind of reasoning.</p>

<p>There are books, of course, which should
not be read by young people, but as a rule
these same books should not be read by
grown people, either. They are essentially
bad, and no one will defend them.</p>

<p>We admit, moreover, that no highly improbable
fiction is healthy as a regular diet.
But we do assert that for a child of undeveloped
imagination&mdash;one who is inclined to
take the world too literally&mdash;there is, perhaps,
nothing better than a well-written
fairy-story. It tends to awaken that faculty
of the brain which gives life half its pleasure.
What, again, can better counteract
the thoughtless cruelty of childhood than
such a story as Black Beauty? And yet,
in the great essential of possibility, Black
Beauty is a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Finally, to one whose mind is over-perplexed
by studies or who is inclined to brood
over the common occurrences of daily life,
what can bring happier relief than some
stirring narrative of adventure? Such a
story at such a time, even if it has no moral
aim, is not without its moral result.</p>

<p>In short, each of these forms of fiction
has its own special and valuable function,
and those who would make the best use of
juvenile literature must recognize the fact
and avail themselves of the principle.</p>

<h3>Telephoning Without Wire</h3>

<p>According to late newspaper accounts, one
of the most striking efforts in the direction of
wireless communication is that of Mr. Nathan
Stubblefield, residing near Murray, in the State
of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Mr. Stubblefield holds the theory that sound
waves, as well as vibrations of ether, can be conveyed
from one point to the other without the
use of wires. To prove this, he has invented an
apparatus of apparently simple construction, consisting
of a transmitter and receiver. Its only
metallic contact with any solid object is by
means of a wire rod, which is sunk into the
ground at the desired point. Through this the
waves of sound are conveyed from the transmitter
to the ground, and from the ground to
the receiver of the other station.</p>

<p>To show that water as well as land will conduct
these vibrations, Mr. Stubblefield established
communication between a boat some distance
from the shore and a station on the land.
From the boat, the strains of a musical instrument
playing on the shore could be distinctly
heard and recognized.</p>

<p>Mr. Stubblefield believes that it is only upon
the question of obtaining a high voltage that the
unlimited application of his system depends.</p>

<p>The many persons who have viewed his experiments
are fully convinced that Mr. Stubblefield
will do much toward furthering the possibilities
of wireless communication.</p>

<h3>The Oxford Scholarships</h3>

<p>In the will of the late Cecil Rhodes, provisions
were made, setting aside $10,000,000 for the founding
of free scholarships for the benefit of students
from the British colonies, Germany, and
the United States. Of these, the United States
is to have two for each State and Territory.
The conditions of these scholarships are that the
candidates must possess the necessary educational
qualifications, manly qualities, a fondness
for out-of-door sports, and an “exhibition during
their school days of moral force of character
and instincts to lead and take interest in their
schoolmates.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rhodes’ purpose is to concentrate the
scattered forces of the Anglo-Saxon race, which,
he believes, contributes the greatest influence
for good upon humanity.</p>

<h3>Terms of Peace in South Africa</h3>

<p>The Edinburgh <i>Evening News</i> of April 12 has
stated that Mr. Kruger, in behalf of the Boers,
desires peace on the following conditions:</p>

<p>Absolute independence will not be made an
issue if otherwise a satisfactory form of government
can be reached.</p>

<p>The proclamation of banishment must be canceled,
the confiscated property restored to its
owners, and all other property destroyed by the
British soldiers must be paid for by their government.</p>

<p>The recognition of both languages in the schools
and courts.</p>

<p>The pardon of rebels and the release of political
prisoners.</p>

<p>All prisoners of war are to be returned to South
Africa on a fixed date.</p>

<p>The foregoing terms and conditions are to be
carried out under the supervision of one or more
of the powers friendly to the Boer cause.</p>

<p>Negotiations have now reached such a point as
to promise a speedy termination of the war in
South Africa.</p>

<h3>General Miles’ Plan for the Philippines</h3>

<p>In the recent correspondence between Lieutenant-General
Miles and the Secretary of War,
the former asked for authority to take with him
to the Philippines ten Cubans and Porto Ricans,
for the purpose of illustrating to the inhabitants
of those islands the beneficial influence of the
United States.</p>

<p>A representative group of Filipinos would
then, on the return journey, be brought to this
country, to familiarize them with our civilization.
In this way it was hoped to establish a more
amicable understanding between the two peoples.</p>

<p>After a careful consideration of General Miles’
plan, the Secretary of War stated his disapproval
of it on the ground that it would be impracticable.</p>

<h3>The Decline of Great Salt Lake</h3>

<p>The Great Salt Lake, which for a number of
years past has been gradually diminishing in size,
is now causing some little apprehension to the
people of Utah. Although not well understood,
it is thought that the diversion of the streams
which formerly fed this interesting body of water,
for the purpose of agriculture, is partly responsible
for its decrease. The cutting away of forests
also is supposed to have had its effect in diminishing
the water supply of the region.</p>

<h3>The Great Power House</h3>

<p>The largest power house in the world is that
recently erected in New York City by the Manhattan
Elevated Railroad. The total energy of
its entire system of engines is 1,000,000 horse-power.
This is capable of being converted into
a force of 600,000 electrical horse-power, in
which form it will be used for propelling the
trains of the elevated railroad.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ROGRAMME AND COIN.&mdash;The
effect of this experiment is as follows:
The performer borrows a marked
half-dollar from a stranger in the audience,
immediately handing it to a gentleman to
examine the mark, date, and other items.
While this is being done, the performer
obtains the loan of a programme, which he
tears in half, laying one half on his table.
The gentleman is now requested to place
the coin in the half of the programme held
by the performer, who wraps it up and gives
it to him to hold. He now goes to his table
for a piece of sealing-wax, which he passes
several times over the packet held by the
gentleman, when immediately it is transformed
into a packet of three envelopes,
made from the programme, all gummed and
sealed, one inside the other, with the
marked half-dollar in the smallest one. As
the gentleman cannot see how it is done,
the performer repeats the trick for his
benefit with the other half of the programme,
but the result is the same. This
time, however, the gentleman is requested
to take the last envelope to the owner of
the money, that he may open it and satisfy
himself that it actually contains his own
coin.</p>

<p>The six envelopes are now rolled up and
given to the gentleman to hand to the
lady, to keep as a souvenir of the entertainment,
but before he has proceeded far
the performer tells him he has dropped one
of them (he has not really done so), and,
failing to find it, he very naturally begins
to count those in his hand, when he discovers
to his astonishment that he holds
the programme restored.</p>

<p><i>Explanation.</i>&mdash;After the performer has
borrowed the half-dollar, in the act of
handing it to the gentleman for examination
he adroitly changes it for one of his
own, bearing the mark of a cross, which
mark, is, of course, taken for that of the
owner of the coin. The performer now
asks for a programme, and while it is being
procured he drops the actual borrowed
coin into the smallest of the three envelopes,
which are placed one inside the other and
concealed by a book or some other object
on the table. To facilitate the introduction
of the coin, a tin tube, with a rather wide
mouth, just large enough for the coin to
pass through, is placed in the smallest envelope.
After this coin has been introduced
this tube is withdrawn, left in its
concealed position, and the envelopes
closed.</p>

<p>The flaps of the envelopes are sealed with
wax beforehand and prepared with the best
gum arabic, which is allowed to dry. They
are moistened with the tongue just before
the performance of the trick, and, if cut as
in Fig. 7, can all be closed at once while
lying on the table. This packet is laid on
the table under cover of the half of a programme
used in the second stage of the
trick.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp42" style="max-width: 10em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fig7.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>To begin, the performer palms a similar
packet of envelopes containing another
half-dollar marked in exactly the same way
as the one he handed to the gentleman, and
it is hardly necessary to say, having the
same appearance
and bearing
the same
date. When
rolling up the
programme the
performer retains
it and
hands the gentleman
the
packet of envelopes;
and
when going to
his table for the
wax leaves half
of the programme
and
the half-dollar
thereon. By the
time the first
coin is taken
from the envelopes the packet containing
the actual borrowed coin will be dry and
ready for use.</p>

<p>The remaining portion of the trick will
now be understood. When the performer
goes for the other half of the programme
he takes the packet of envelopes with it
and substitutes it as before, and the trick
proceeds as described. When collecting
the six envelopes for the final effect, the
performer palms a duplicate programme
which has been lying on his table behind
some object, and substitutes this as before
when giving the gentleman the envelopes
to hand to the lady.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Filtrated Coin.</span>&mdash;Borrow a half-dollar
from one of the company, wrap it up in a
handkerchief, and request some one to hold
it over a glass of water.</p>

<p>Presto! The coin is dropped into the
glass and heard to jingle. When the handkerchief
is removed the half-dollar has disappeared,
apparently dissolved in the
water. This very effective trick is accomplished
by means of a glass disc of the
same diameter as a half-dollar. The modus
operandi is as follows: Borrow a half-dollar
and while holding it in your hand
throw a handkerchief over it. Under cover
of the handkerchief exchange the coin for
the glass disc which you have concealed in
your palm. Now get some one to hold the
disc by its edges through the handkerchief,
directly over the glass of water. He naturally
supposes that he is holding the
coin.</p>

<p>Pronounce your magical phrase, and command
your volunteer assistant to drop the
half-dollar into the glass. It will fall with
a jingle similar to that of a coin, and will
lie invisible at the bottom of the glass.
You may even pour off the water, but the
disc, thanks to the power of suction, will remain
in the same position, firmly attached
to the drinking-glass. To complete the
effect the genuine half-dollar should then be
produced from under the table or from the
pocket of the volunteer assistant.</p>

<h3><i>CHANGE OF NAME</i></h3>

<p>As most of our readers are aware, the name
originally used for this magazine was only
temporary, to be continued until a better one
might be found. Many other names have been
suggested, but none of them seemed to be just
what was wanted. A name that has been in
our minds from the beginning was <span class="smcap">Youth</span>, but,
for the reason that it had already been used with
another publication, we could not adopt it. We
have now purchased the right to use this name,
and shall continue it henceforth. It has the
advantage of being a title of but one word, a
short one at that, and one that is catchy, suggestive,
and easily remembered. We hope that
it will meet with cordial favor at the hands of
all our subscribers.</p>

<h3><i>WELCOME TO OUR NEW FRIENDS</i></h3>

<p>We have not only purchased the right to use
the name of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>, but we have also arranged
to fill out with this journal the unexpired subscriptions
to the magazine formerly published
at Buffalo, N. Y. We hope that our new
friends will not only be satisfied with this arrangement,
but that they will be so well pleased
as to permanently remain with us.</p>

<h3><i>MANUSCRIPTS</i></h3>

<p>The publishers of <span class="smcap">Youth</span> will be glad to
examine manuscripts submitted for publication.
They should, if possible, be type-written, with
the name and address of the writer appearing
on the first page. Stamps should be enclosed
for their return if unavailable. Prompt attention
will be given to all manuscripts, and such
as are found available will be paid for upon
acceptance, not upon publication. While all
manuscripts will be examined impartially, we
shall, of course, be disposed to consider with
greater favor those submitted by our subscribers,
as we wish to encourage them as much
as possible to contribute to our columns.</p>

<h3><i>DATE OF PUBLICATION</i></h3>

<p>It will be noticed that, this month, the magazine
reaches our subscribers much earlier than
any former issue. We now have everything in
such working order that we shall be able to do
even better with succeeding numbers. It is our
intention to eventually have the magazine in
the hands of our subscribers by the first of the
month.</p>

<h3><i>$100 PRIZE STORY</i></h3>

<p>In order to encourage our readers to literary
effort, we have decided to offer a cash prize of
$100 for the best short story for young people,
from one to five thousand words in length,
suitable for publication in this magazine. Full
particulars in regard to this offer will be found
in the advertising pages of this issue. The
offer is confined exclusively to subscribers of
<span class="smcap">Youth</span>, and we hope to see a large number of
stories entered from them for competition.</p>

<h3><i>TELL YOUR FRIENDS</i></h3>

<p>If you are pleased with <span class="smcap">Youth</span>, we hope you
will tell your friends about it, and thus aid very
substantially in increasing our circle of acquaintances.
In case you have any criticisms or suggestions,
we shall be very glad to receive them.
<span class="smcap">Youth</span> is published in the interest of its subscribers,
and while we have many ideas which we
will carry out in the immediate future, we would
be glad, nevertheless, to receive the criticism
and advice of our subscribers. It is our purpose,
as far as possible, to meet their views.</p>

<h3><i>50c. FOR TWENTY-FIVE NAMES</i></h3>

<p>Anyone who will send us the names and addresses
of twenty-five of his friends, boys or
girls, and fifty cents additional, will receive a
year’s subscription to <span class="smcap">Youth</span>. The magazine
will be sent to any desired address. This is a
very easy way for any person, young or old, to
obtain a year’s subscription. We wish the
twenty-five names for the sole purpose of distributing
sample copies of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>. They will be
put to no other use, so that no one need have
any hesitation in sending the list.</p>

<h3><i>AN EASY WAY TO EARN MONEY</i></h3>

<p>In order to increase the circulation of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>
as rapidly as possible, we have decided to make
some exceptional inducements to boys and girls to
obtain subscriptions. The work can be done after
school hours, and on Saturdays and holidays.
The arrangement we make for doing the canvassing
renders the work very agreeable, and the
commission offered is so large that it cannot fail to
be an inducement.</p>

<p>To such of our readers as would like to earn a
considerable sum of money with little effort, we
suggest that they send us their names and addresses,
and we will at once forward full particulars.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
